"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9637415,R01HG009136,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Phenomena', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Dwarfism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Polyadenylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinically relevant', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exon skipping', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'knock-down', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,582191,0.09083633580050883
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9722284,R01HG009674,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Fate Control', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell fusion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Pattern', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'RNA Interference', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heterokaryon', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'nuclear reprogramming', 'pluripotency', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,703311,0.06611440423934513
"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9614325,F32HG009226,"['Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional adaptation', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'precision genomic medicine', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'trend', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,46114,0.11265287287854484
"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9625746,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,620335,0.11165341553991084
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization. I will develop innovative computational and statistical strategies to investigate 3D genome organization at an unprecedented scale, thereby elucidating the impacts of genome organization on gene regulation and disease.",Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation,9798957,R35GM133678,"['3-Dimensional', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complement 3d', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome Stability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Play', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'deep sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'spatiotemporal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R35,2019,369984,0.051449508669071504
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9753292,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,468156,0.0474289136892054
"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9673749,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,392270,0.093212298477948
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types.

Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects.

Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9623355,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,284020,0.043534406981359394
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,9752643,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,437500,0.04537478446962862
"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9761568,R21HG010070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Allelic Imbalance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HNF4A gene', 'Heart Diseases', 'HepG2', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasmids', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,236250,0.1028647042523843
"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",9699641,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2019,356979,0.11218454623326797
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF.

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9751340,R35GM128938,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2019,449829,0.05925222577092745
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points.

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses. It will thus provide an essential foundation for the immunogenic understanding of immune responses in health and disease.",ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells,9763427,R24AI072073,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Biology', 'Boston', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cloud based', 'cohesin', 'cost effectiveness', 'cytokine', 'data access', 'differential expression', 'immune activation', 'immunogenic', 'mobile application', 'programs', 'response', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R24,2019,1673172,0.06172699369928002
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9738125,R01DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CDH1 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Loss', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nasal cavity', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'craniofacial', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,225980,0.05210131241072436
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9766882,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2019,1497668,0.1343331475219425
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9789336,R01GM129126,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Knock-out', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Repression', 'Resources', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ursidae Family', 'Writing', 'Yeasts', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314166,0.05114094826179571
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9762140,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,513500,0.10723041141215049
"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9774269,R01GM131398,"['Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Genes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,325001,0.1165173209627116
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9629973,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2019,742538,0.06043820968693234
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9786812,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,352626,0.08187598040487627
"Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes Forward genetic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped thousands of loci regulating disorders of the heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS), implicating widespread sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, their functions, mechanisms of action and how they impact disease is still unclear. To solve this new and important GWAS bottleneck, we use a functional genomics-inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions and how DNA variants in them affect HLBS diseases. Taking advantage of our long-standing expertise and successes in complex, cardiovascular disorders, and novel computational methods we have recently developed, we propose novel genomics analyses of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program phenotypes and their whole genome sequences, together with publicly available epigenomics data, to identify the molecular bases of HLBS disease. We will first focus on the transcriptional machinery controlling heart physiology and its disorders before exploring other HLBS-relevant tissues and disorders in collaboration with other TOPMed investigators. Our specific aims are: (1) Identifying the transcriptional machinery in the heart and other HLBS relevant tissues; and, (2) Connecting genomic variation in the transcriptional machinery to HLBS traits. Our approach will enable identification of the core molecular components that control HLBS tissues and how they are compromised in HLBS disorders. The major hypothesis explaining the results of heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific HLBS genes and, thereby, modulate variation in the phenotype and disorders. In this proposal, we advance new computational approaches to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (TF, CRE, target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions so that the effects of causal genetic variation can be identified within identified trait loci genome- wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding HLBS trait and disease variation, a major public health challenge.",Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes,9692018,R01HL141980,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'causal variant', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'reverse genetics', 'success', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,436249,0.03203830447324378
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,9670347,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2019,672622,0.08286231368623341
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",9645655,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,615264,0.052981443486032405

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Linking human enhancers to predictive models of mRNA abundance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A central challenge in understanding the genetic origins of disease is the inability to isolate which regions of the genome are functionally responsible for the aberrant expression of genes. To date, nearly 85% of identified disease-causing mutations lie within protein-coding exons (i.e. the “exome”), which comprises 2% of the human genome. Yet an estimated 50-75% of Mendelian disorders, and an even greater proportion of non-Mendelian (i.e. polygenic) diseases, have unexplained genetic etiologies which are suspected to involve genetic variants in the remaining 98% of the human non-coding genome. Over the past 5 years, new genome-scale technologies have uncovered the existence of ~400,000 enhancer-like regions. Mutations in these regions are suspected to be a major source of the misregulation of gene expression levels, which can in turn manifest in disease. Nevertheless, the vast majority of these regions have never been directly tested for their ability to activate transcription, nor have they been definitively linked to the regulation of target genes. The K99 training phase of this award entails the development of a new generation of massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) technologies that can interrogate the functional activity of 10,000-100,000 enhancers with high precision and reproducibility, an order of magnitude more than is currently possible (Aim 1). Coordinated with this effort will be the quantitative modeling of biological determinants that are predictive of enhancer activity (Aim 2). Complementing Aims 1 and 2 is the development of models designed to infer enhancer-promoter regulatory interactions. Towards this goal, self-attentive models, derived from the field of computational linguistics, will be trained to learn how the epigenetic marks and transcription factor binding events associated with distal enhancers contribute to gene expression levels in a diversity of cell types (Aim 3). As this work transitions into the R00 independent phase of the award, deep convolutional neural networks will be trained to learn how underlying DNA sequences encode epigenetic and transcription factor binding information. This would thereby generate a mathematical function which links DNA sequence directly to gene expression levels, which would help to predict how specific genetic variants in distal enhancers might perturb the mRNA levels of target genes. These predictions will help to inform—at single nucleotide resolution—which genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies are causally linked to disease (Aim 4). Collectively, these aims will give insight into the cis-regulatory logic encoded in DNA that specifies mRNA abundance. The methods developed herein will lay a quantitative framework with which to evaluate enhancer function, prioritize which genetic variants are likely to be associated with disease, and shed light onto the elusive functions of the non-coding regions of the human genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goals of this project are to develop a technology that can measure the activity of >10,000 enhancers in parallel, and to devise quantitative models that describe the impact of enhancers on gene expression levels. Achieving these goals will give insight into the cis-regulatory logic encoded in DNA that specifies mRNA abundance. We anticipate that these methods will shed light upon the elusive functions of non-coding regions in the human genome, and help to dissect the molecular origins of diverse genetic diseases.",Linking human enhancers to predictive models of mRNA abundance,9804719,K99HG010662,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'convolutional neural network', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'model design', 'model development', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,1,0.07256129343053705
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9695242,K99HG009920,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enhancers', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plasmids', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biochemical model', 'career', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'personalized medicine', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'skills', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,90935,0.10947124405884735
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9654772,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'functional/structural genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,9675210,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,836792,0.04096953343977508
"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease,9805238,K99HG010669,"['African', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Climate', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Height', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immunity', 'Lassa Fever', 'Left', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic tools', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'lens', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,124916,0.03198974609654502
"Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance Reduced insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance (IR) is a forerunner of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Differences in the prevalence of IR among ethnic groups suggest its genetic etiology. However, recent studies implementing genetic association approaches were only nominally successful in defining the genetically-regulated molecular and cellular mechanisms of IR. Our physiologic and genomic studies suggest that (a) IR results from derangement in expression of thousands of genes in tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, and (b) genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determine the expression level of a subset of IR-associated genes. Thus, transcript levels are key molecular phenotypes associated with IR and are proximal to the action of genetic variants. A subset of genetically-regulated transcript subnetworks that operate within the large highly interconnected global expression networks in disease-relevant tissues can cause IR, but remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that, regulatory SNPs in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) determine transcript levels of key driver genes, configure the expression subnetworks in adipose and muscle tissue, and are causal determinants for IR. The genetic architecture of eQTLs determines the heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of IR. Our preliminary data support the concept of causal genetic regulators of subnetworks in modulating insulin sensitivity. Challenging the current paradigms, our Aim 1 is to implement our cutting-edge Multiscale Network Modelling Approach to integrate measures of glucose homeostasis (SI and Matsuda index from FSIVGT and OGTT, respectively); adipose and muscle tissue transcript profiles; eSNP data from African American participants in the AAGMEx cohort (N=260); and genetic and epigenetic regulation data from knowledge bases to discover subnetworks and genetic drivers that are causally linked to IR. In Aim 2, we will validate insulin sensitivity-associated genetically-regulated subnetworks, and determine common and ethnically-predominant genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR, using multi-omics data from similarly phenotyped European ancestry individuals from the METSIM (N=770) and AREA (N=99) cohorts. These results will be compared with those from the AAGMEx cohort. Key driver genes of insulin sensitivity-associated genetically regulated adipose and muscle tissue subnetworks from Aims 1-2 will then be prioritized based on statistical ranking to validate their regulatory roles. In Aim 3, we will focus on understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms modulated by 10 selected putative key regulatory genes. Using in vitro genetic perturbation experiments in relevant human cell models we have already established, we will modulate the expression of these genes, identify target pathways, and examine IR-determining cellular mechanisms (e.g. metabolism, signal transduction, differentiation, inflammation, cell-cell interaction) regulated by these genes. Our study will be among the first to define the genetic regulatory networks of IR, a key step towards development of novel therapeutic options for prevention of IR and subsequent T2D. Deciphering the underlying molecular defects and genetic regulatory mechanisms of insulin sensitivity is an unmet need to develop novel and safe therapeutic options to prevent insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes and other diseases of major public health importance. Building on our success in recruiting cohorts of metabolically well-characterized and molecularly profiled non-diabetic African and European Ancestry individuals, and creating a data resource that is suitably powered to conduct integrative multi-omics analysis, we will implement a novel computational approach to discover fat and muscle tissue gene regulatory networks and driver genes that are causally linked to insulin resistance. Leveraging expertise of our multidisciplinary research team in cell and molecular biological studies this project will define mechanistic roles for the computationally predicted key regulatory genes in determining insulin resistance and thus help inform new strategies to treat and even prevent the rapidly growing public-health challenge of type 2 diabetes, particularly among African Americans.",Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance,9728964,R01DK118243,"['Adipose tissue', 'African', 'African American', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscle', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'causal model', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'density', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic phenotype', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'small hairpin RNA', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,347047,0.04274116525761727
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9735333,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,527403,0.006200580161104012
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9637410,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,387500,0.06316797477670068
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9667439,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362238,0.07437342538188887
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9475243,R01HG009136,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Phenomena', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Dwarfism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Polyadenylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exon skipping', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'knock-down', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,590281,0.09083633580050883
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9420632,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,620335,0.11165341553991084
"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9406681,F32HG009226,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional adaptation', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'precision genomic medicine', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'trend', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,57066,0.11265287287854484

"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9486376,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,226333,0.093212298477948
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,9574761,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2018,437500,0.04537478446962862
"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9509167,R21HG010070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Allelic Imbalance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HNF4A gene', 'Heart Diseases', 'HepG2', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasmids', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2018,196302,0.1028647042523843
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms.

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Project Narrative Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9576241,R35GM128938,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2018,449829,0.05925222577092745
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased. This project will provide that high-resolution view.",Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes,9423525,R01GM125722,"['Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-protein crosslink', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Event', 'Formaldehyde', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'billboard', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'crosslink', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'protein profiling', 'recruit', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'syntax', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2018,320584,0.05890287108964832
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9552890,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543228,0.06810264469569542
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity.

"Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing ABSTRACT Biorepositories are critical to enabling modern molecular-based research that will drive the development of a new generation of targeted diagnostics and therapies as well as personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The use of data and biospecimen resources collected during research are constrained by the informed consent that research participants give to research teams, research protocol documents, and the constraints imposed on the research by the IRB itself. Currently there is a lack of a common model of consent that limits how easily data (and research specimens) from multiple research projects, or multiple institutions can be combined for large-scale retrospective studies. Manually examining and reconciling potentially millions of informed consent forms from different biobanks becomes an expensive and possibly irreconcilable problem. The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. Additionally, much of the regulatory processes involved in research are still based on paper-based workflows. We posit that by developing suitable machine-based metadata representation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents would enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to 1) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, 2) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and 3) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies. More specifically we will focus on three specific aims: 1) Develop standard-conforming metadata representations of informed consent; 2) Develop NLP-based automatic annotation tool for informed consent documents; and 3) Evaluate the metadata-ontology-based approach for semantically representing the domain and demonstrate its capacity for answering competency questions. Our proposed approach is novel for the following reasons: 1) it provides the first metadata ontology, to the best of our knowledge, to represent the informed consent space while considering the US common rules; 2) it combines natural language processing technologies with ontology-based approaches for semantic annotation as well as ontology enrichment; and 3) it engages stakeholders in the ontology development and evaluation process and uses competency questions to verify the coverage of the ontology.

In response to RFA-CA-15-017, this proposed project will develop suitable machine-based metadata representation and automatic annotation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents.

"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9578803,R01GM129126,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Knock-out', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Repression', 'Resources', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ursidae Family', 'Writing', 'Yeasts', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,311500,0.05114094826179571
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs. We have developed a prototype technique that leverages eRNAs to infer the activity of all TF in a cell simultaneously.",A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity,9596778,R01GM125871,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Platelet Disorders', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ESR1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Estradiol', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Waardenburg syndrome', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cooking', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2018,286702,0.04476583353452763
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9490337,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,397299,0.06365043126492399
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,0.09615305950471449
"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer. RegulomeDB will enable researchers, clinicians, and sophisticated computer programs to relate DNA variants that lie in previously poorly understood regions of the human genome to possible functions thereby helping us understand the genetic basis of human variation and disease.",RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome,9420648,U41HG009293,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Research', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'cell determination', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cloud based', 'computer program', 'gene function', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outreach', 'social media', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'web-accessible', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U41,2018,733299,0.06915771132984039
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9425925,R01HG009906,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,383250,0.043534406981359394
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9450518,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,362333,0.07437342538188887
"Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes Forward genetic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped thousands of loci regulating disorders of the heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS), implicating widespread sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, their functions, mechanisms of action and how they impact disease is still unclear. To solve this new and important GWAS bottleneck, we use a functional genomics-inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions and how DNA variants in them affect HLBS diseases. Taking advantage of our long-standing expertise and successes in complex, cardiovascular disorders, and novel computational methods we have recently developed, we propose novel genomics analyses of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program phenotypes and their whole genome sequences, together with publicly available epigenomics data, to identify the molecular bases of HLBS disease. We will first focus on the transcriptional machinery controlling heart physiology and its disorders before exploring other HLBS-relevant tissues and disorders in collaboration with other TOPMed investigators. Our specific aims are: (1) Identifying the transcriptional machinery in the heart and other HLBS relevant tissues; and, (2) Connecting genomic variation in the transcriptional machinery to HLBS traits. Our approach will enable identification of the core molecular components that control HLBS tissues and how they are compromised in HLBS disorders. The major hypothesis explaining the results of heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific HLBS genes and, thereby, modulate variation in the phenotype and disorders. In this proposal, we advance new computational approaches to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (TF, CRE, target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions so that the effects of causal genetic variation can be identified within identified trait loci genome- wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding HLBS trait and disease variation, a major public health challenge.",Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes,9521873,R01HL141980,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'reverse genetics', 'success', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,438051,0.03203830447324378
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9500095,R01HG010045,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'markov model', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,411292,0.08187598040487627
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders.

"2/2-Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers associated with the development of psychiatric disorders In this project, we will develop novel methods for finding brain-specific enhancers, build regulatory networks, deconvolve brain-region-specific regulation, and relate differential enhancer signals to variations in the human population.

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. No changes from original submission Contact PD/PI: Chakravarti, Aravinda The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9521770,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,592501,0.10723041141215049
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease.

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Orofacial clefting is a common disease that causes significant morbidity for the affected individual and a major burden to families and society. The etiology of orofacial clefting is complex, but genetic factors contribute significant risk. To date, scores of genes have been identified where rare variants cause rare syndromic forms of orofacial clefting, and DNA variants at 24 loci have been associated with the common non-syndromic form of orofacial clefting. Despite these efforts, less than half of the heritable risk has been identified. In addition, the pathogenic variant has yet to be determined at most of the 24 associated loci. New approaches are needed to identify these genetic risk factors. Since most of the associated loci are located between genes, it is hypothesized that the pathogenic allele is in a regulatory element. Thus, the new approaches should not only help find new candidate genes but they should also find the elements that regulate the expression of those genes. In this proposal, we will use a triumvirate approach to find new candidate genes, the DNA elements that regulate their expression and the transcription factors that bind to those regulatory elements. In total, analysis of these three datasets will yield a gene regulatory network for a target tissue. The target tissue for this proposal is periderm. Periderm is the most superficial layer of squamous epithelial cells that covers the entire embryo, including the oral cavity. Recent studies from human and animal models identified 19 genes that are essential for periderm development, and of these, 10 have DNA variation that causes or increases risk for orofacial clefting. Despite its significant role in palate development, little is known about periderm at the molecular level. The immediate goals of this proposal are to i) determine the gene regulatory network for periderm and ii) apply that new knowledge to identify alleles within the 24 associated loci that perturb the gene regulatory network for periderm. The longterm goals of this proposal are to identify genetic pathways that are essential for periderm differentiation and to identify the actual pathogenic DNA variants that perturb these pathways. This new knowledge will help determine recurrence risk and provide opportunities to develop new rational therapies. In particular, since periderm only exists in the embryo and since it is the most superficial layer of the embryo, it is an ideal target for in utero therapies, when and where orofacial clefting actually occurs. We have two parallel specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm differentiation in zebrafish by systematically perturbing the system. In Aim 2, we will use a parallel approach to determine the gene regulatory network for mouse periderm. It is essential to use both animal models because while studies of zebrafish periderm led to the identification of genes required for development of the lip and palate, the “periderm” between these two clades has a different embryonic origin and it is possible aspects of the gene regulatory network are different. Our project thus exploits the power and tractability of the zebrafish, and the human-like origin of periderm in the mouse. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9783225,R56DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'RNA analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Transposase', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Zebrafish', 'clinically significant', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'member', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'prenatal therapy', 'promoter', 'rare condition', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R56,2018,339622,0.09375418743433452
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,9448210,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,699831,0.04096953343977508
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9433692,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9420630,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,387500,0.06316797477670068
"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9613971,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,546403,0.006200580161104012
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9420631,U01HG009395,"['ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2018,717318,0.06043820968693234
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples.

"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies. In addition, the project will provide biological insight into the tissue-specificity and population-specificity of genomic features that characterize regulatory genetic variants.

"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9502066,F32HG009226,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional adaptation', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'precision genomic medicine', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'trend', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,2400,0.11265287287854484
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9368022,R01HG009674,"['ATAC-seq', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Fate Control', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell fusion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Event', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Pattern', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'RNA Interference', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'combinatorial', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heterokaryon', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'nuclear reprogramming', 'pluripotency', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,694416,0.06611440423934513
"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9247598,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,620335,0.11165341553991084
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9382313,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'learning network', 'men', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2017,471007,0.0474289136892054
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9356566,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,463781,0.06810264469569542
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9247640,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2017,654000,0.1343331475219425
"Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing ABSTRACT Biorepositories are critical to enabling modern molecular-based research that will drive the development of a new generation of targeted diagnostics and therapies as well as personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The use of data and biospecimen resources collected during research are constrained by the informed consent that research participants give to research teams, research protocol documents, and the constraints imposed on the research by the IRB itself. Currently there is a lack of a common model of consent that limits how easily data (and research specimens) from multiple research projects, or multiple institutions can be combined for large-scale retrospective studies. Manually examining and reconciling potentially millions of informed consent forms from different biobanks becomes an expensive and possibly irreconcilable problem. The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. Additionally, much of the regulatory processes involved in research are still based on paper-based workflows. We posit that by developing suitable machine-based metadata representation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents would enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to 1) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, 2) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and 3) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies. More specifically we will focus on three specific aims: 1) Develop standard-conforming metadata representations of informed consent; 2) Develop NLP-based automatic annotation tool for informed consent documents; and 3) Evaluate the metadata-ontology-based approach for semantically representing the domain and demonstrate its capacity for answering competency questions. Our proposed approach is novel for the following reasons: 1) it provides the first metadata ontology, to the best of our knowledge, to represent the informed consent space while considering the US common rules; 2) it combines natural language processing technologies with ontology-based approaches for semantic annotation as well as ontology enrichment; and 3) it engages stakeholders in the ontology development and evaluation process and uses competency questions to verify the coverage of the ontology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. In response to RFA-CA-15-017, this proposed project will develop suitable machine-based metadata representation and automatic annotation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents. The proposed approach will presumably enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to (a) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, (b) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and (c) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies.",Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing,9360131,U01HG009454,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readability', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Specimen', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Trust', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'biobank', 'common rule', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'human subject', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'permissiveness', 'personalized medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U01,2017,456710,0.047115949463019315
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9280975,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,397299,0.06365043126492399
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states.

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer. RegulomeDB will enable researchers, clinicians, and sophisticated computer programs to relate DNA variants that lie in previously poorly understood regions of the human genome to possible functions thereby helping us understand the genetic basis of human variation and disease.",RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome,9209087,U41HG009293,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Research', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'cell determination', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cloud based', 'computer program', 'gene function', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outreach', 'social media', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'web-accessible', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U41,2017,782177,0.06915771132984039
"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes. In turn, this improved understanding will bring forth new potential targets to approach incorrect regulation leading to disease.",Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements,9478475,R00HG007356,"['Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Continuing Education', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'LIF gene', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transfection', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'member', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'online course', 'programs', 'promoter', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'undergraduate student', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R00,2017,50000,0.10699339984171631
"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way.

"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9253408,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,284959,0.09869992480395609
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9276695,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,356861,0.07437342538188887
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders. Our work will provide new insight into the identity, composition and biological requirement for these gene switches, informing our understanding of mutations that contribute to common genetic disorders.",Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon,9291510,R01NS062972,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Megacolon', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Dopamine', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Instruction', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Midbrain structure', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Ontology', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prosencephalon', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Switch Genes', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'disorder risk', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'encryption', 'experience', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hindbrain', 'human disease', 'insight', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,461190,0.11420363365408878
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9265137,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Deep learning frameworks for regulatory genomics. PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of genome sequencing and functional genomic data in multiple cellular contexts across healthy and diseased individuals provides a unique opportunity to decipher the regulatory and genetic architecture of diseases and traits. Novel computational methods are required that can address fundamental problems involving data representation, data integration, learning accurate predictive models from large-scale datasets and extraction of novel biological insights from complex models. We propose novel machine learning frameworks based on deep neural networks with new interpretation and hypothesis generation engines capable of integrating a wide variety of key genomic data types to learn predictive models of chromatin architecture and chromatin state; integrative models of transcription factor binding; determinants of macroscale three-dimensional genome architecture involving long-range chromatin contacts and the regulatory basis of functional non-coding, regulatory variants. Our methods are highly generalizable to several other related problems in regulatory genomics and lay the foundation for a paradigm shift in computational genomics.

"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies. In addition, the project will provide biological insight into the tissue-specificity and population-specificity of genomic features that characterize regulatory genetic variants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of patients and other individuals.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants. Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.",Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation,9039648,R01HG006264,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Housing', 'Human Genetics', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Splicing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,308000,0.06524227242667158
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9157021,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404036,0.06810264469569542
"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,9067925,R01AI106775,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Antibodies', 'Antimalarials', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Erythrocytes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Parasite Control', 'Parasite resistance', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'base', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,452972,0.04359550977313883
"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),9068802,K22AI112570,"['Address', 'Affect', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelial', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Junk DNA', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'NCAM1 gene', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Immunity', 'North America', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'training opportunity', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2016,105224,0.05469273952792268
"Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing ABSTRACT Biorepositories are critical to enabling modern molecular-based research that will drive the development of a new generation of targeted diagnostics and therapies as well as personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The use of data and biospecimen resources collected during research are constrained by the informed consent that research participants give to research teams, research protocol documents, and the constraints imposed on the research by the IRB itself. Currently there is a lack of a common model of consent that limits how easily data (and research specimens) from multiple research projects, or multiple institutions can be combined for large-scale retrospective studies. Manually examining and reconciling potentially millions of informed consent forms from different biobanks becomes an expensive and possibly irreconcilable problem. The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. Additionally, much of the regulatory processes involved in research are still based on paper-based workflows. We posit that by developing suitable machine-based metadata representation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents would enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to 1) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, 2) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and 3) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies. More specifically we will focus on three specific aims: 1) Develop standard-conforming metadata representations of informed consent; 2) Develop NLP-based automatic annotation tool for informed consent documents; and 3) Evaluate the metadata-ontology-based approach for semantically representing the domain and demonstrate its capacity for answering competency questions. Our proposed approach is novel for the following reasons: 1) it provides the first metadata ontology, to the best of our knowledge, to represent the informed consent space while considering the US common rules; 2) it combines natural language processing technologies with ontology-based approaches for semantic annotation as well as ontology enrichment; and 3) it engages stakeholders in the ontology development and evaluation process and uses competency questions to verify the coverage of the ontology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. In response to RFA-CA-15-017, this proposed project will develop suitable machine-based metadata representation and automatic annotation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents. The proposed approach will presumably enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to (a) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, (b) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and (c) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies.",Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing,9161167,U01HG009454,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Specimen', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'common rule', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'human subject', 'improved', 'information processing', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'stem', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U01,2016,471848,0.047115949463019315
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9066171,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'research study', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,397299,0.06365043126492399
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9206289,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.09615305950471449
"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way.

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9038385,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,284106,0.09869992480395609
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.            ",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9106490,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cofactor', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,360706,0.07437342538188887
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders. Our work will provide new insight into the identity, composition and biological requirement for these gene switches, informing our understanding of mutations that contribute to common genetic disorders.",Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon,9084287,R01NS062972,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Megacolon', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Dopamine', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Instruction', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Midbrain structure', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Ontology', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prosencephalon', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Switch Genes', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'disorder risk', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'encryption', 'experience', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hindbrain', 'human disease', 'insight', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'promoter', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,461141,0.11420363365408878
"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes.

We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.            ",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9101722,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation No abstract available Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret.

"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies. In addition, the project will provide biological insight into the tissue-specificity and population-specificity of genomic features that characterize regulatory genetic variants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of patients and other individuals.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants. Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.",Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation,8822892,R01HG006264,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Housing', 'Human Genetics', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Splicing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,300300,0.06524227242667158
"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8928618,R01ES024992,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Junk DNA', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mammalian genome', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,152500,0.0729754689408248
"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,8862371,R01AI106775,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Antibodies', 'Antimalarials', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Erythrocytes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Parasite Control', 'Parasite resistance', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'base', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,451989,0.04359550977313883
"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations. Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.",Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE,9090935,U01HG007033,"['Achievement', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Indium', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'neoplastic', 'risk variant', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2015,362142,0.0498697995476974
"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases. Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained. Existing functional predication software or algorithms only query some databases without providing statistical or biological integration, and dismiss much valuable regulatory information. We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain. We will also use a novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our prediction. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will be made public via a website and standalone application.

"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.              ",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),8749475,K22AI112570,"['Address', 'Affect', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelial', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Junk DNA', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'NCAM1 gene', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Immunity', 'North America', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2015,161200,0.05469273952792268
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs. Our models will serve as a resource to provide comprehensive context-specific regulatory annotations for disease-associated gene sets and co-expression modules.",Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation,8921203,R01ES025009,"['Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Indium', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Play', 'Process', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318763,0.15208672596807934
"ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.            ",ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER,8888066,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397299,0.06611781687045677
"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing. These studies will provide significant insight into how splicing is regulated, and how epigenetic and environmental signals disrupt splicing in human diseases.",Epigenomic control of RNA splicing,8921202,R01ES024995,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Kinetics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Work', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'information organization', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,308000,-0.012936310389817494
"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions.

"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.                ",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,8847548,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,283300,0.09869992480395609
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus.

"Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated. The novel bioinformatics methods developed by this project will help in silico discovery and research for accelerating the linkage of phenotypic and genomic information, at gene-isoform level. Public health relevance statement:  The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by alternative splicing and alternative transcription is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. The development of bioinformatics methods and user-friendly  software in this study will provide useful tools to better understand gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and more importantly, how dis-regulation of these mechanisms leads to a variety of diseases.",Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level,8843951,R01LM011297,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Fertility', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'TP73 gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer initiation', 'cost', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuropsychiatry', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web-accessible']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,337196,0.04015807677481012
"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.          Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.            ",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8815597,R01ES024992,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Junk DNA', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mammalian genome', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,189100,0.0729754689408248
"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.            ",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,8675801,R01AI106775,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Antibodies', 'Antimalarials', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Erythrocytes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Parasite Control', 'Parasite resistance', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'base', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,454989,0.04359550977313883
"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.           Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.  Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases. The proposed study is to investigate the fundamentals of neuronal RNA complexity at the systems level, using a combination of high-throughput experimental technologies and novel integrative computational methods.",An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks,8601105,R00GM095713,"['Age', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Foxes', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Phase', 'Polyadenylation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer studies', 'design', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mRNA Export', 'mRNA Stability', 'markov model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2014,249000,0.044550336760969554
"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained. Existing functional predication software or algorithms only query some databases without providing statistical or biological integration, and dismiss much valuable regulatory information. We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain. We will also use a novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our prediction.

"An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites. The analysis using the TF-gene networks will elucidate the transcriptional regulations of TZDs, which will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders.            ",An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs,8640941,R21DK098769,"['2,4-thiazolidinedione', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brown Fat', 'Burn injury', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calories', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Obesity', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Property', 'RNA', 'RXR', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'adipokines', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cofactor', 'design', 'epigenome', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insulin sensitivity', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2014,200000,0.07142544036562504
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs. Our models will serve as a resource to provide comprehensive context-specific regulatory annotations for disease-associated gene sets and co-expression modules.            ",Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation,8815902,R01ES025009,"['Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Indium', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Play', 'Process', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,318763,0.15208672596807934
"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing.

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8628862,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2014,520701,0.06381017497428466
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3).

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated. The novel bioinformatics methods developed by this project will help in silico discovery and research for accelerating the linkage of phenotypic and genomic information, at gene-isoform level.             Public health relevance statement:  The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by alternative splicing and alternative transcription is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.          Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.           Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.            ",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,8557512,R01AI106775,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Antibodies', 'Antimalarials', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Erythrocytes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Parasite Control', 'Parasite resistance', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'base', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,396836,0.04359550977313883
"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.

"An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites. The analysis using the TF-gene networks will elucidate the transcriptional regulations of TZDs, which will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders.            ",An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs,8491522,R21DK098769,"['2,4-thiazolidinedione', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brown Fat', 'Burn injury', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calories', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Obesity', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Property', 'RNA', 'RXR', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'adipokines', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cofactor', 'design', 'epigenome', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insulin sensitivity', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2013,240000,0.07142544036562504
"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory 'code' dictating our cellular processes. In turn, this improved understanding will bring forth new potential targets to approach incorrect regulation leading to disease.                ",Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements,8564428,K99HG007356,"['Accounting', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Continuing Education', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transfection', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2013,94346,0.10540136977805346
"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8463019,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2013,493524,0.06381017497428466
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition. Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.",Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome,8309335,F32GM095273,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Arabidopsis', 'Assimilations', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fertilizers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrogen', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-DNA', 'TF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Water Pollution', 'base', 'genome-wide', 'ground water', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'network models', 'nutrition', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2012,53942,0.081169657429455
"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.

The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.               Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8311335,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2012,556291,0.06381017497428466
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.          Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and  predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures. Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              n/a",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,8132645,U01HG004561,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'forest', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2010,430000,0.07277037442622636
"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy).

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures. Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Nuclear Receptor Networks in Human Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex disorders typically involve multiple factors and gene loci and are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This is particularly true for metabolic diseases and diseases affecting mental health. As is often the case with such illnesses, regulators of gene expression, as well as their specific target genes can play a major role in not just the etiology but also the treatment of the disease. Some of the best characterized regulators associated with human disease are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily -- transcription factors that are regulated by the binding of ligands that are often influenced by environmental conditions. However, while a great deal is known about the mechanism by which individual nuclear receptors regulate the expression of individual target genes, what is sorely lacking is a comprehensive view of all their potential target genes in all the tissues in which they are expressed. This is true not only for metabolic organs for which the role of nuclear receptors is fairly well studied, but also the CNS where much less is known about the target genes and the functions of the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, several nuclear receptors are very effective drug targets, for both metabolic and mental disorders, making them among the most clinically relevant of all the transcription factors. Whereas recent advances in whole genome expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq) have allowed us to begin to define the complete transcriptome for some of these factors, much more remains to be done. Furthermore, these approaches can be technically challenging and costly, and hence very limiting. A complementary approach that has not been fully exploited is a computational one based on the DNA response elements that recruit the nuclear receptors to the regulatory regions of their target genes. However, in order to take full advantage of this approach, one must first have a comprehensive dataset of the binding motifs to which the receptors bind. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to comprehensively define the DNA binding specificity of a critical group of nuclear receptors using high throughput technology; and 2) to use that data to mine existing datasets in order to associate those nuclear receptors with human disease. These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Use protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to determine the DNA binding specificity of select nuclear receptors on 10's of 1000's of unique sequences; and then use that data to develop high accuracy computational models to predict the entire set of sequences to which a given nuclear receptor binds; 2) use the PBM data and models generated in Aim 1 to computationally identify all the potential binding sites, target genes and related SNPs in the human genome for each nuclear receptor; and cross reference the results with databases linking genes and SNPs to human diseases (i.e., GAD and HapMap); 3) incorporate the results into a network of nuclear receptors and their target genes, with particular emphasis on metabolic diseases and mental health disorders. All of the binding motifs, potential target genes, related SNPs and networks will be catalogued in the on-line resource PAZAR, a public database of transcription factor and regulatory sequence annotation (http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/index.pl), and the NIH-funded Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) (http://www.nursa.org/). Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. The recent sequencing of the human genome has allowed us to identify new genes associated with these diseases at an ever increasing rate. In this study we apply the latest high throughput technology to help identify variations in the genetic sequence that might be related to those (and other) diseases by examining the regulatory regions of genes and the proteins that bind those regions. Our work will help bring us closer to an era of personalized medicine in which prevention, diagnosis and treatment are tailored to the individual patient, making them more effective and less costly.           Project Narrative Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              n/a",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,7684267,U01HG004561,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'forest', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2009,430878,0.07277037442622636
"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Nuclear Receptor Networks in Human Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex disorders typically involve multiple factors and gene loci and are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This is particularly true for metabolic diseases and diseases affecting mental health. As is often the case with such illnesses, regulators of gene expression, as well as their specific target genes can play a major role in not just the etiology but also the treatment of the disease. Some of the best characterized regulators associated with human disease are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily -- transcription factors that are regulated by the binding of ligands that are often influenced by environmental conditions. However, while a great deal is known about the mechanism by which individual nuclear receptors regulate the expression of individual target genes, what is sorely lacking is a comprehensive view of all their potential target genes in all the tissues in which they are expressed. This is true not only for metabolic organs for which the role of nuclear receptors is fairly well studied, but also the CNS where much less is known about the target genes and the functions of the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, several nuclear receptors are very effective drug targets, for both metabolic and mental disorders, making them among the most clinically relevant of all the transcription factors. Whereas recent advances in whole genome expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq) have allowed us to begin to define the complete transcriptome for some of these factors, much more remains to be done. Furthermore, these approaches can be technically challenging and costly, and hence very limiting. A complementary approach that has not been fully exploited is a computational one based on the DNA response elements that recruit the nuclear receptors to the regulatory regions of their target genes. However, in order to take full advantage of this approach, one must first have a comprehensive dataset of the binding motifs to which the receptors bind. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to comprehensively define the DNA binding specificity of a critical group of nuclear receptors using high throughput technology; and 2) to use that data to mine existing datasets in order to associate those nuclear receptors with human disease. These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Use protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to determine the DNA binding specificity of select nuclear receptors on 10's of 1000's of unique sequences; and then use that data to develop high accuracy computational models to predict the entire set of sequences to which a given nuclear receptor binds; 2) use the PBM data and models generated in Aim 1 to computationally identify all the potential binding sites, target genes and related SNPs in the human genome for each nuclear receptor; and cross reference the results with databases linking genes and SNPs to human diseases (i.e., GAD and HapMap); 3) incorporate the results into a network of nuclear receptors and their target genes, with particular emphasis on metabolic diseases and mental health disorders. All of the binding motifs, potential target genes, related SNPs and networks will be catalogued in the on-line resource PAZAR, a public database of transcription factor and regulatory sequence annotation (http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/index.pl), and the NIH-funded Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) (http://www.nursa.org/). Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network.

"Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity The focus of the proposed research is to understand the effect of sequence variation on the function of molecular networks. We will develop computational algorithms that integrate genotype, gene expression and phenotype data to construct models that describe how sequence variation perturbs the regulatory network, alters signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes. Our approach is based on Bayesian networks, a framework we pioneered for the reconstruction of molecular networks from high-throughput data. We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization. n/a",Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity,7937675,DP2OD002414,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Double Effect', 'Drops', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              n/a",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,7502766,U01HG004561,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Localized', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'forest', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2008,418301,0.07277037442622636
"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           n/a",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7392219,R01HG003470,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mating Types', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulon', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Score', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shock', 'Sigma Factor', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'programs', 'promoter', 'research study', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2008,294338,0.10704709888621157
"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites. NARRATIVE mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.          n/a",Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues,7432898,R01GM084089,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Microarray Chip', 'DNA Microarray format', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease regression', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Introns', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Poly A', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polyadenylation Pathway', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'human disease', 'improved', 'preference', 'research study', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2008,304200,0.06410882135689298
"Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer Principal Investigator: Sander, Chris Project Summary / Abstract We propose to apply computational algorithms from the Columbia University National Center for Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet) to study gene regulatory networks in human cancer. The project will be led by the Computational Biology Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and will build an intensive collaboration between computer scientists and clinical researchers. The aims of this project are to:  Make discoveries about gene regulation in soft tissue sarcoma and prostate cancer.  Strengthen the National Center's computational tools for the analysis of gene regulation and biological pathways, and  Develop better methods for predicting disease outcome in cancer patients. Specifically, advanced computational algorithms and software developed as part of this project will be used to predict gene regulators and their targets from mRNA and microRNA expression profiles. We propose to study three types of gene regulation in cancer samples: i) transcription of protein coding genes ii) transcription of microRNA genes and iii) translational regulation of protein coding genes by mature microRNAs. The predicted regulatory events will be compared with biological knowledge in pathway databases in order to discover novel regulatory events, detect biological processes characteristic of specific cancer subtypes and assess the accuracy of the prediction algorithms. Such detailed knowledge of gene regulation can improve the prediction of clinical outcomes and guide the choice of therapy for individual patients. Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer Principal Investigator: Sander, Chris Project Narrative We propose to analyze molecular genetic data from cancer patients using advanced computational methods.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network. Furthermore, E.coli is at the forefront in systems biology as a proof-of-concept biological model to develop new methodologies in bioinformatics, representation and simulation, to overcome challenges in order to model and understand the functioning of a whole cell.          n/a",Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling,7526482,R01GM071962,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Biotechnology', 'Boston', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Research', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sigma Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Text', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transduction Gene', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'concept', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2008,408032,0.08947090572112826
"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome.

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           n/a",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7221303,R01HG003470,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mating Types', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulon', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Score', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shock', 'Sigma Factor', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'programs', 'promoter', 'research study', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R01,2007,299796,0.10704709888621157
"Computational discovery of cis-regulatory sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall aim of this research proposal is to combine computational and functional methodologies to develop a set of algorithms with high positive predictive value for identifying and classifying candidate cis-regulatory sequences sites in the vicinity of any gene of interest. The underlying hypothesis is that functional non-coding sequences - particularly those governing a set of tissue-specific genes - will evince common features at the sequence level that can be identified computationally and modeled with sufficient precision to enable accurate de novo predictions. However, it is expected that the overall predictive value of computational approaches alone will be comparatively low. Rather, employed as a screening tool in combination with a high throughput functional validation methodology, computational approaches of even low (10-20%) predictive potential would be of enormous value, enabling rapid culling of tens of thousands of cis-regulatory sequences from the human genome.  The strategy employed will commence with development of a catalogue of functional non-coding sequences for a set of tissue- and lineage-specific human genes. This will be achieved by precise localization of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) surrounding 100 erythroid-specific and 100 lymphoid lineage -restricted genes. Both tissues represent highly developed experimental systems, and a substantial amount of information has already come to light concerning both cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms operative within these cell types. DNaseI hypersensitivity in vivo is the sine qua non of a diverse cast of transcriptional regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and locus control regions. The utility of the nuclease hypersensitivity assay for identification of in vivo-functional regulatory sequences is unmatched: it is a mature, functionally-based approach validated by a vast literature and decades of highly productive studies encompassing hundreds of human and other eukaryotic genes. A comprehensive catalogue of HSs surrounding any gene would therefore be expected to encompass the majority - if not all - of its cognate transcriptional control elements active in the tissues under study.  Next, a significant data mining effort will be undertaken. This phase will involve (i) structural comparisons among identified functional elements; (ii) identification of candidate transcription factor binding sites within HS sequences using motif analysis methodologies; (iii) identification of correlations with ancillary genomic features such as transcriptional start sites, CpG islands, and certain classes of repetitive sequences; and (iv) structural comparisons between in vivo functional sequences and evolutionarily conserved sequences within the study regions. A major focus will be application of model techniques such as hidden Markov models, technology from gene prediction programs, and classifier kernel methods such as support vector machines. Based on these analyses, initial models for prospective detection of cis-regulatory regions will be developed.  Finally, these models will be tested in and out of sample for sensitivity and specificity. Positive feedback from successfully confirmed sites will be utilized to refine the information collected above, thereby enhancing the basic model. Predictive techniques will then be applied systematically to discover cis-regulatory sequences surrounding erythroid, lymphoid, and diverse other classes of human genes.  The resulting database will be of incalculable value in furthering the study of the regulation of human genes and the computational methodologies employed therein. n/a",Computational discovery of cis-regulatory sequences,7281307,R01GM071923,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conserved Sequence', 'CpG Islands', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Erythroid', 'Feedback', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Localized', 'Locus Control Region', 'Lymphoid', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'data mining', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'markov model', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2007,578070,0.08814611135727035
"Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity The focus of the proposed research is to understand the effect of sequence variation on the function of molecular networks. We will develop computational algorithms that integrate genotype, gene expression and phenotype data to construct models that describe how sequence variation perturbs the regulatory network, alters signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes. Our approach is based on Bayesian networks, a framework we pioneered for the reconstruction of molecular networks from high-throughput data. We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization. n/a",Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity,7431104,DP2OD002414,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Double Effect', 'Drops', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Face', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"Genomic Reconstruction of Yeast Transcription Networks DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organisms devote a significant fraction of their genomes to encoding regulatory information which specifies when and where different genes should be turned on or off. Such information is essential for understanding development, tissue specificity, and cellular response to the environment and has great importance for understanding the molecular basis of disease. The one dimensional regulatory programs encoded in DNA are executed by transcription factors which respond to different conditions and regulate gene expression combinatorially, leading to complex regulatory networks. The goal of the proposed research is to develop theoretical models and computational algorithms to decipher the regulatory programs and to reconstruct the transcription networks in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The following are the specific aims: 1) to systematically map the DNA recognition sites and target genes of transcription factors in the genome, 2) to identify environmental and genetic perturbations under which each transcription factor is activated or deactivated, 3) to systematically analyze combinatorial regulation by multiple transcription factors, 4) collaborate with two experimental labs to address specific problems of transcriptional regulation and combinatorial control, and 5) to build databases and online tools for the biological community to analyze gene expression data and transcriptional regulation.

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           n/a",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7096896,R01HG003470,"['DNA', 'binding sites', 'bioinformatics', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genome', 'neoplasm /cancer', 'proteins', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R01,2006,302050,0.10704709888621157

By              comparing the homologous regulons in several bacterial species we can study the      gain and loss of gene from common regulatory pa ways, the rates at which             binding sites specificities change, and the duplication and divergence of            regulatory proteins and the genes they regulate.                                                                                                                          We wil1 continue the development and enhancement of methods to predict RNA           structures, especially comparative-based methods that attempt to find common         structure, for collections of sequences These methods will be applied to             several types of sequences including: {\em in vitro} selection product;              structural RNA families; mRNA motifs involved in post-transcriptional                regulation of gene expression.                                                                                                                                            Each of these projects will be enhanced through collaborations with other            groups, primarily experimentalists, who are interested in the application of         our methods to their biological problems.                                                                                                                                 n/a",DNA PATTERN IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS,6291580,R01HG000249,"['DNA', ' DNA binding protein', ' RNA', ' artificial intelligence', ' bacterial genetics', ' binding sites', ' biomedical automation', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gene expression', ' mathematical model', ' method development', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' nucleic acid structure', ' posttranscriptional RNA processing', ' protein sequence', ' regulatory gene']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,261800,0.08746239661024792
"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9869019,R01HG009136,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Phenomena', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Dwarfism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Polyadenylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinically relevant', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exon skipping', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'knock-down', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,573285,0.09083633580050883
"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10065897,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,31454,0.034230066229579206
"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position. Project Narrative Targeting regulatory elements has the advantage of concurrently attacking multiple damaged pathways, with the possible pitfall of toxicity due to adverse unintended effects. Understanding the functional global impact of therapy on the entire transcriptome will guide us in designing drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity.

"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9851890,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large scale data', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'machine learning method', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,620335,0.11165341553991084
"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10039384,K01MH123896,"['Affect', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'genomic profiles', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K01,2020,94262,0.05870623218060007
"Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) Predictive Models of Boundaries of Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) in Human. The PI proposes a high-impact research project to develop novel predictive models to predict boundaries of topologically associated domains in a variety of human cell lines. The goal of this proposal is not just building these models, but to interpret them to decipher some biological meaning. Studies have recently indicated that genomes of different organisms are organized into domains called topologically associated domains (TADs), which consist of self-interacting chromatin regions. The boundaries of TADs have been linked to several diseases and gene regulation by modulating the overall genome organization. Accurate identification of these boundaries and interpretation of regulatory units in the boundaries are essential for development of effective therapy for diseases in future. Since existing experimental methods are costly and challenging, we will explore, evaluate, and compare predictive models for accurate prediction of TAD boundaries in different cell lines. We propose to test if sequence and chromatin features can be used in traditional feature based predictive models for TADs boundaries. This will be compared to deep learning models which have the capacity to “learn” important discriminative features from sequence information only. By interpreting these models, we will characterize the regulatory code of TAD boundaries by (a) characterizing a comprehensive list of motifs in TAD boundaries in 10 different human cell lines, (b) characterizing the association between different chromatin features and their predicting power of the boundaries, and (c) scoring, ranking and prioritizing likely causal noncoding variants that occur in TAD boundaries. Furthermore, this proposal will enhance the infrastructure of research and education at University of Houston-Downtown, introducing computational biology research experiences to underrepresented minority, first time in college and female undergraduate students, who would otherwise lack such opportunities. This will allow them to acquire a broad area of skills in data analytics, critical thinking, and research methods, which will encourage them to pursue a biomedical career and change their lives and communities. Understanding genome organization is essential for deciphering the complex mechanisms associated with gene regulation and development of effective therapies for diseases. To address current experimental challenges to quantify genome organization, we propose to develop novel artificial intelligence predictive methods to decipher genome organization in humans. These methods will also help link how genome organization modulates gene expression and how it can contribute to diseases.",Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs),9965292,R15GM137254,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Consumption', 'Critical Thinking', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Education', 'Enhancers', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'long short term memory', 'mammalian genome', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON-DOWNTOWN,R15,2020,399888,0.04810215480937986
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9900769,R01DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CDH1 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Loss', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Mammalian Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nasal cavity', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'craniofacial', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,560204,0.05210131241072436
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites. The development of new computational methods in combination with generation of experimental binding data will reveal the protein- family specific use of readout modes at atomic, molecular, and cellular scales.",Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,9975181,R35GM130376,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Major Groove', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'functional group', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2020,523665,0.019476331654426356
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9840492,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,395000,0.043534406981359394
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9932470,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,517318,0.10723041141215049
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization.

"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9904747,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,86356,0.093212298477948
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9984421,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'diverse data', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,464920,0.0474289136892054
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. One of the main bottlenecks in analysis of genomic data is efficient and scalable visualization approaches. The PEGR open source platform will provide programmatic access to any number of human cell sequenced datasets, from any stage of NGS processing, with the pipeline analysis results available for high-throughput machine learning testing and development. This project will empower discovery through the automated analysis and visualization of results from both small- and large-scale datasets. This architecture will include the following features: 1) a secure, cloud-based, metadata management system that instills best practices of experimental rigor, reproducibility, and data sharing; 2) automated Galaxy-based epigenomic data processing pipelines that provide easy-to-use “wizards” for standardized processing of common epigenomic data types; and 3) an easily de-ployable, open source software package as a means to disseminate data, tools, and discoveries via cloud services.

"A database for high-resolution chromatin contact maps and human genetic variants Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, several landmarking consortia have accumulated large amounts of genomic data towards understanding the functions of human genome. The ENCODE project has annotated genome-wide regulatory elements. The Roadmap Epigenomic project has characterized tissue-speciﬁc variation in epigenetic state. The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has delineated tissue-speciﬁc gene expression and transcription regulation. The NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project has revealed dynamic 3D chromatin organization in many cell and tissue types. Each of the aforementioned consortia has generated thousands or even tens of thousands of datasets, and provided different insights regarding human genome at an unprecedent scale and depth. However, the datasets generated from these consortia are isolated in terms of cell types and tissue types covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data. These gaps bring realistic data analysis challenges to biomedical researchers when they use these public datasets jointly in their research — they need to go through different data portals with heterogeneous processing pipelines, different data formats, and unmatched resolutions. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches to impute high-resolution chromatin contact maps, and integrate the high-resolution chromatin contact maps with transcriptional data available from GTEx project and epigenomic data from ENCODE/Roadmap. We plan to share the integrated data on a public web server with a multi-panel interactive visualization genome browser. The integrated data will provide an important resource for understanding of tissue-speciﬁc genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to integrate 4DN datasets with GTEx datasets and ENCODE/Roadmap datasets. The integrated datasets will be critical resource to unveil the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies.

"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,9908170,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2020,592430,0.08286231368623341
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9932407,R01GM131398,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,325001,0.1165173209627116
"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10021007,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2020,356979,0.11218454623326797

"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF.

"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9980439,R35GM128938,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2020,449649,0.05925222577092745
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses. It will thus provide an essential foundation for the immunogenic understanding of immune responses in health and disease.",ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells,9994813,R24AI072073,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Biology', 'Boston', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cloud based', 'cohesin', 'cost effectiveness', 'cytokine', 'data access', 'differential expression', 'immune activation', 'immunogenic', 'mobile application', 'programs', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cells', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'web site']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R24,2020,1673172,0.06172699369928002
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9855022,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,742538,0.06043820968693234
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9952404,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2020,1496387,0.1343331475219425
"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3). Our experimental & computational approaches are broadly applicable and our results are relevant to environmental N-use affecting human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This work illustrates a combined experimental and computational approach to discover gene regulatory networks in a pathway, process, or trait - applied across a range of problems in biology, agriculture and medicine.

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer.

"Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance Reduced insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance (IR) is a forerunner of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Differences in the prevalence of IR among ethnic groups suggest its genetic etiology. However, recent studies implementing genetic association approaches were only nominally successful in defining the genetically-regulated molecular and cellular mechanisms of IR. Our physiologic and genomic studies suggest that (a) IR results from derangement in expression of thousands of genes in tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, and (b) genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determine the expression level of a subset of IR-associated genes. Thus, transcript levels are key molecular phenotypes associated with IR and are proximal to the action of genetic variants. A subset of genetically-regulated transcript subnetworks that operate within the large highly interconnected global expression networks in disease-relevant tissues can cause IR, but remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that, regulatory SNPs in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) determine transcript levels of key driver genes, configure the expression subnetworks in adipose and muscle tissue, and are causal determinants for IR. The genetic architecture of eQTLs determines the heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of IR. Our preliminary data support the concept of causal genetic regulators of subnetworks in modulating insulin sensitivity. Challenging the current paradigms, our Aim 1 is to implement our cutting-edge Multiscale Network Modelling Approach to integrate measures of glucose homeostasis (SI and Matsuda index from FSIVGT and OGTT, respectively); adipose and muscle tissue transcript profiles; eSNP data from African American participants in the AAGMEx cohort (N=260); and genetic and epigenetic regulation data from knowledge bases to discover subnetworks and genetic drivers that are causally linked to IR. In Aim 2, we will validate insulin sensitivity-associated genetically-regulated subnetworks, and determine common and ethnically-predominant genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR, using multi-omics data from similarly phenotyped European ancestry individuals from the METSIM (N=770) and AREA (N=99) cohorts. These results will be compared with those from the AAGMEx cohort. Key driver genes of insulin sensitivity-associated genetically regulated adipose and muscle tissue subnetworks from Aims 1-2 will then be prioritized based on statistical ranking to validate their regulatory roles. In Aim 3, we will focus on understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms modulated by 10 selected putative key regulatory genes. Using in vitro genetic perturbation experiments in relevant human cell models we have already established, we will modulate the expression of these genes, identify target pathways, and examine IR-determining cellular mechanisms (e.g. metabolism, signal transduction, differentiation, inflammation, cell-cell interaction) regulated by these genes. Our study will be among the first to define the genetic regulatory networks of IR, a key step towards development of novel therapeutic options for prevention of IR and subsequent T2D. Deciphering the underlying molecular defects and genetic regulatory mechanisms of insulin sensitivity is an unmet need to develop novel and safe therapeutic options to prevent insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes and other diseases of major public health importance. Building on our success in recruiting cohorts of metabolically well-characterized and molecularly profiled non-diabetic African and European Ancestry individuals, and creating a data resource that is suitably powered to conduct integrative multi-omics analysis, we will implement a novel computational approach to discover fat and muscle tissue gene regulatory networks and driver genes that are causally linked to insulin resistance. Leveraging expertise of our multidisciplinary research team in cell and molecular biological studies this project will define mechanistic roles for the computationally predicted key regulatory genes in determining insulin resistance and thus help inform new strategies to treat and even prevent the rapidly growing public-health challenge of type 2 diabetes, particularly among African Americans.",Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance,9959404,R01DK118243,"['Adipose tissue', 'African', 'African American', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscle', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'causal model', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'density', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic phenotype', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'small hairpin RNA', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,378487,0.04274116525761727
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",9867736,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,607933,0.052981443486032405
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9968281,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,527403,0.006200580161104012
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9873080,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'functional/structural genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'stem cells', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9850271,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387500,0.06316797477670068
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease. The results will also improve the ability to engineer metabolic pathways to produce a protein, chemical, drug or other compound.",Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries,9929602,R01GM125809,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Process', 'Gene Library', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sum', 'Synthetic Genes', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'human disease', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolic engineering', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'scale up', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,347304,0.08505118222756536
"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,9891599,R03DE028588,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body part', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'TWIST1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computational pipelines', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'falls', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'multiple omics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2020,164000,0.0856755940297459
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9996761,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,352626,0.08187598040487627
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk.

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease,10005404,K99HG010669,"['African', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Climate', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Height', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immunity', 'Lassa Fever', 'Left', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic tools', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'lens', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2020,125378,0.03198974609654502
