"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10136105,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,317000
"Digital Phenotyping To Screen For Early Childhood Internalizing Disorders ABSTRACT Childhood anxiety and depression are common, impairing, and have the potential to disrupt development well into adulthood. Pediatricians need mental health screening tools to meet the prevalence of these internalizing disorders early in childhood. We have developed a promising digital health approach for detecting movement and speech phenotypes of internalizing disorders in young children. My long-term goal is to create a novel technology for screening young children for internalizing disorders at scale. My short-term objective is to leverage my original approach and my proposed training curriculum to create a prototype mobile health (mHealth) application that provides a composite digital phenotype to detect childhood internalizing disorders. My specific aims are to (1) evaluate the validity of digital phenotypes measured by a novel mHealth system for identifying internalizing disorders in young children and (2) develop a composite digital phenotype for childhood internalizing disorders involving multiple constructs from the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and identify moderating RDoC construct variables. If successful, these mHealth enabled digital phenotypes may be used to further NIMH health initiatives of enabling better tracking of changes in internalizing mental health status across childhood and supporting new and innovative research-practice partnerships with pediatrics to improve dissemination of evidence-based mental health screening. Similarly, this approach answers a need identified by the American Academic of Pediatrics for new tools that screen for behavioral and emotional problems. Seventy children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, oversampled for internalizing disorders, will be recruited for this study from pediatric and childhood mental health services at a university-based regional medical center that services the state of Vermont and up-state New York. They will be administered mood induction tasks design to press for RDoC Negative and Positive Valence constructs, while instrumented with a belt-worn smartphone enabled with the prototype mHealth application. A composite digital phenotype will be developed across constructs based on statistical classification models trained using machine learning on data captured during the tasks. To carry out this work as an independent investigator, I propose an intensive training curriculum to gain foundational skills in digital phenotyping. It includes training in (1) developmental epidemiology to better research early childhood psychopathology through a public health lens, and (2a) mobile app development to communicate effectively with app developers (2b) analysis of complex systems including machine learning approaches, (2c) ethical and societal issues regarding digital psychiatry. Completion of these training and research aims will provide me the skills and evidence to develop an easily-administered digital health technology for identifying young children with internalizing disorders in the short-term, and in the long- term, the ability to successfully contribute to the emerging field of digital health for the purpose of improving childhood mental health. This proposed project will advance a brief, feasible digital health approach to detect anxiety and depressive disorders in young children using wearable sensors. If successful, this approach has the potential to identify young children who are suffering with mental illness. The proposed training plan will allow this applicant to contribute significantly to the emerging field of digital psychiatry as an independent investigator as a long-term career.",Digital Phenotyping To Screen For Early Childhood Internalizing Disorders,10127012,K23MH123031,"['Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'New York', 'Parents', 'Partnership Practice', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Valence', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Social Processes', 'Socialization', 'Speech', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Vermont', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'child depression', 'childhood anxiety', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'disease classification', 'early childhood', 'early screening', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research study', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sex', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K23,2021,161889
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,10220354,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,559759
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,10122959,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,16342
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,10053725,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,656876
"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas. Evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended by national psychosis treatment guidelines, but are inaccessible in routine practice. The objective of this proposal is to systematically develop, pilot, and rigorously test CBTpro, a novel clinician support tool designed to train community mental health workers to provide cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis skills to their clients. CBTpro merges cutting- edge technology with best psychotherapeutic practices for serious mental illness to enable a rapid research, development, and testing pipeline.",CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies,10126065,R42MH123215,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Design', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Workforce Development', 'arm', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective intervention', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'quality assurance', 'rehearsal', 'repository', 'research and development', 'response', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'scale up', 'severe mental illness', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'societal costs', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'usability', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIMH,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R42,2021,472872
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",10149406,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Poverty', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2021,367436
"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,10085684,R34MH119170,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Service delivery model', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavior test', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dietary', 'digital health', 'disorder risk', 'emotional distress', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'outreach', 'parental involvement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'self help', 'service delivery', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'uptake']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,232006
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10387466,UG1DA040309,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Community Networks', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Fire - disasters', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Maine', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'National Clinical Trials Network', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New Hampshire', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vermont', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cocaine use', 'college', 'community organizations', 'comorbidity', 'data privacy', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'digital treatment', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'high school', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana use', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'personalized health care', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'research study', 'rural setting', 'scale up', 'screening', 'smart watch', 'social media', 'special interest group', 'substance use treatment', 'telehealth', 'treatment disparity', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,UG1,2021,249933
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10238174,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2021,249000
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,10062524,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,553209
"Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  To inform an effective response to the opioid epidemic, understanding the multilevel factors that influence risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical. In addition, although the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD is proven, long-term retention in treatment has been a challenge. Thus, efforts are needed to identify program implementation factors that can be strengthened to improve OUD treatment outcomes. The K01 Award will provide the candidate the requisite skills and mentored research experience necessary to meet her long-term goal of conducting independent, innovative research on OUD and its treatment that can guide strategic investment to prevent OUD and inform implementation of MAT programs to increase patient adherence. This proposal comprises a 5-year plan that includes mentorship by Wade Berrettini, MD, PhD, Brian Schwartz, MD, MS, H. Lester Kirchner, PhD, MS, Danielle Mowery, PhD, MS, and Alanna Kulchak Rahm, PhD, MS; didactic training activities to meet the candidate's training goals; and conduct of a two-phase research project that will provide the candidate with substantive experience leading epidemiologic research using electronic health record (EHR) data and in implementation science. The proposed research will be conducted at Geisinger, an integrated healthcare system serving a large geographically diverse region of Pennsylvania, leveraging its research assets—including a wealth of health-related EHR data and linked genetic data—and the ability to integrate research into the clinical environment. The aims of the research are twofold. Aim 1 centers on the social determinants that engender vulnerability to OUD, evaluating associations of community contextual factors related to socioeconomic, social, and physical conditions with OUD, and the role individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions play in these relations. Aim 1 will utilize EHR and genetic data from Geisinger patients (n = 18,728) coupled with secondary data characterizing community factors to conduct a nested case-control study. Aim 2 seeks to understand program implementation factors that impact patient adherence to MAT for OUD. Aim 2 is a mixed methods study that will involve interviews with key informants (n ≈ 30) to identify multilevel barriers and facilitators influencing MAT success, followed by a survey of adult patients (n = 500) in Geisinger's MAT clinics to quantify factors influencing MAT adherence from a patient perspective. Completion of this research will fulfill the candidate's short-term goals by providing training in: (1) OUD, its treatment, and substance use disorder research; (2) natural language processing; (3) measurement of contextual factors; (4) statistical analysis including multilevel modeling and mediation analysis; (5) gene-environment interaction research; and (6) implementation science. The proposed research will generate evidence to understand novel, understudied risk factors for OUD, with implications for investment in community-level prevention interventions, and how health systems can improve treatment retention among individuals with OUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research will elucidate how community contextual factors related to economic, social, and physical conditions work in conjunction with individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions in generating or mitigating risk for opioid use disorder. It will also identify program implementation factors at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels that influence adherence to medication-assisted treatment among patients with opioid use disorder. The research results will inform investment in preventive interventions where community conditions may increase risk for opioid use disorder as well as how health systems can increase retention in treatment programs for opioid use disorder.",Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy,10202540,K01DA049903,"['Abate', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adult', 'Buprenorphine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dropout', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Qualitative Research', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biobank', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'case control', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'contextual factors', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'health data', 'illicit opioid', 'implementation determinants', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'rural counties', 'scale up', 'skills', 'social', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program']",NIDA,GEISINGER CLINIC,K01,2021,162032
"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,10237892,R01MH124076,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early-life trauma', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'brain health', 'child and adolescent victimization', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'physical assault', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'risk prediction', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic stress', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization', 'youth violence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,714526
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10223137,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,445292
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10118191,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2021,177444
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Here, we take advantage of a new technology to directly measure serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine on a sub-second basis to investigate the neurocomputational role of these neurotransmitters in risky choice.",Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making,10141302,R01MH122948,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morale', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'noradrenergic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,654439
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief. These findings may advance understanding of the process of grief, facilitate early identification of high-risk grievers and potentially form the basis for targeted treatment of complicated grief.",Predicting complicated grief from grief processing,10124433,K23MH114021,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Stimulus', 'Suicide', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Trauma', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intense pain', 'loved ones', 'neural patterning', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2021,199800
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10162387,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,759049
"Personalized Mapping of Affective Lability PROJECT SUMMARY Affective lability (AL) is a common psychiatric symptom characterized by rapid mood fluctuations. Clinically significant AL often begins in adolescence, is present in both psychiatric disorders and the general population, and is a major risk factor for suicide. However, the developmental substrates of AL remain only sparsely described. Prior studies have implicated deficits of top-down regulation between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the amygdala; the FPN is also known to undergo protracted maturation into young adulthood. However, previous efforts have been limited by methodological obstacles related to underlying biological heterogeneity of the FPN. Cortical networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a 1:1 mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However, recent studies using precision functional mapping techniques have demonstrated reliable individual differences in functional topography, i.e., the spatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. Notably, the FPN is both critical for affect regulation and also has the most variable functional topography of any cortical network. This proposal will capitalize upon new machine learning tools to map the FPN on a personalized basis to test the over-arching hypothesis that AL is associated with developmental abnormalities of FPN topography and connectivity. In Aim 1, we will continue to acquire a sample of 30 adolescents and young adults (ages 16-21) with affective lability and 20 matched comparators using smartphone-based digital phenotyping and multi- modal imaging. In Aim 2, we will capitalize upon a recently-completed longitudinal study (n=200, 10-25 years old, mean follow up interval = 5 years) that will allow us to understand how longitudinal changes in personalized FPN topography and connectivity associate with AL. Taken together, this project will provide valuable new insights regarding circuit-level developmental deficits associated with AL, and provide the candidate with superb training in computational psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Affective lability is a common symptom of multiple psychiatric conditions in youth and is one of the strongest predictors of suicide. Here, we propose to use machine learning tools to identify circuit-level deficits associated with affective lability in individual adolescents and young adults. This knowledge may be critical for the development of personalized therapeutics for the treatment of affective lability.",Personalized Mapping of Affective Lability,10140765,F31MH123063,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological heterogeneity', 'burden of illness', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'common symptom', 'digital', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'personalized therapeutic', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'stem', 'tool', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,10102280,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38161
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,10092219,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2021,33126
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10264169,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,590213
"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults. This proposal promises to identify new treatment targets for the prevention of stress-related psychopathology.",ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES,10256803,R01MH121735,"['5 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brothers', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Heritability', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Inherited', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Primates', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Puberty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxiety-like behavior', 'anxious temperament', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'brain circuitry', 'child depression', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'emerging adult', 'emotional behavior', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genetic pedigree', 'girls', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'mature animal', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'preadolescence', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,743109
"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain Stem', 'Clinical', 'Cochlea', 'Cohort Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Protection', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outcome Study', 'Outer Hair Cells', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Students', 'System', 'Temporary Threshold Shift', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cochlear synaptopathy', 'conditioning', 'demographics', 'dosimetry', 'ear muscle', 'farmer', 'hearing impairment', 'middle ear', 'musician', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'professor', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sound', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973

"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10250551,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Child Welfare', 'Cicatrix', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Earthquakes', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Household', 'Imagery', 'Indian Ocean', 'Individual', 'Indonesia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Natural Disasters', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Domains', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Shock', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Sumatra', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Variant', 'Water', 'acetone hydrazone', 'adverse childhood events', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'environmental change', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'human capital', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'member', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'sea level rise', 'success', 'tool', 'weather patterns', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,498320
"A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis Project Summary/Abstract: The research and training plan for this Fellowship will provide the applicant with significant and foundational training in cognitive neuroscience, advanced computational approaches and neuroimaging analysis to support her long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher dedicated to enhancing functional recovery in schizophrenia. A core feature of schizophrenia is severe disability in social functioning, which places a high burden on individuals and society. Effective treatment development for social functioning deficits is hindered by the lack of well-defined neural and cognitive treatment targets. Recent advances suggest cortical loss in prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be linked to poor functioning in chronic schizophrenia, however the relationship between specific neural targets and social functioning in first episode psychosis (FEP), when individuals may have greater ability to engage in substantial recovery, is largely unknown. Further, social cognition deficits are strongly linked to poor functioning, but the relationship between cortical loss in social cognitive brain regions and social functioning remains to be established. The purpose of this study is to employ data-driven approaches to identify neural and social cognitive markers of social functioning in health and FEP to inform treatment target identification. This cross-sectional, secondary analysis leverages two unique datasets – a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=1113), and a sample of FEP participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Minnesota (n=40). Specific Aim 1 - examine the relationships between gray matter volume and cortical thickness, social cognition and social functioning in healthy young adults using data driven approaches - will answer two research questions: 1a) what brain regions estimate better social functioning in healthy young adults, using regression-based machine learning analysis? and 1b) Is the relationship between social functioning and measures of gray matter volume and cortical thickness mediated by social cognition? We will then translate these findings to an FEP sample in Aim 2 - characterize the relationship between gray matter volume and cortical thickness and social functioning in FEP. This research will be supported by the applicant’s comprehensive training plan, her interdisciplinary mentoring team, and an ideal training environment due to its sophisticated neuroimaging and health informatics resources. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between the brain, social cognition and social functioning, which could lead to more targeted interventions for functional deficits in schizophrenia, alleviating suffering and addressing a critical public health need. The training will position the applicant to continue her trajectory to an independent career in translational cognitive neuroscience to enhance functional recovery through the development of neuroscience-informed interventions. Project Narrative: This research will identify relationships between neural substrate, social cognition and social functioning in healthy and first episode psychosis samples in order to identify the bio-behavioral processes that support social functioning and to identify potential neural treatment targets for improving social functioning deficits in psychotic disorders. This research aligns with the National Institute of Mental Health priority of elucidating the neural processes of complex behaviors to inform novel treatments. Identification of treatment biomarkers for social functioning is critical in order to advance treatment development and optimization for functional deficits in psychosis that will result in significant public health impact by reducing disability and promoting quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis,10153037,F31MH124278,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Development', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'aged', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'connectome', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'first episode psychosis', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social relationships', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'treatment optimization', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2021,41879
"Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Aging-induced cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction is the primary factor in impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) responses and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), contributing to the genesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice as well as bioassay experiments in cultured endothelial cells treated with sera from human patients, non-human primates and rodent models of aging provide compelling evidence that implicates non-cell autonomous mechanisms as key drivers of endothelial aging processes. Guided by analysis of vascular transcriptomic changes in heterochronic parabiont mice the objective of the proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation activated by specific circulating anti-geronic factors present in young blood. The central hypothesis is that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes. The resulting increases in CBF and NVC responses reduce ischemic loci, promoting brain health. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine the role of the cerebromicrovascular NAD+ /SIRT1 axis in rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE rescues the age-related decline in NAD+, which rejuvenates cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells via a SIRT1-dependent pathway. It is predicted that disruption of the NAD+ /SIRT1 axis will prevent cerebrovascular rejuvenation by HBE in aged mice. 2) Determine the role of circulating IGF-1 in cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE reverses age-related IGF-1 deficiency, which exerts multifaceted endothelial protective effects contributing to cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by young blood. It is predicted that HBE-mediated endothelial functional and transcriptomic changes are partially prevented by disruption of IGF-1/IGFR1 signaling. 3) Determine how circulating NAD precursors and IGF-1 in young and old humans determine cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and phenotype. This will be tested by bioassaying the effects of circulating factors and integrating the results with existing endothelial function, NVC and CBF data from the serum donors. To optimize cognitive status prediction with automated machine learning we will perform association analyses of endothelial signatures with cerebrovascular and cognitive measures using linear mixed effect models. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the involvement of two key mechanisms in the protective effects of HBE against cerebromicrovascular aging and the pathogenesis of VCID. NARRATIVE The human brain is supplied by a dense array of vessels where each neuron has its supplying capillary. Aging impairs functionally and structurally the cerebromicrovasculature and thus induces consequential neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Our recent studies using heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice showed that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes, improving brain health.",Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange,10208361,RF1AG072295,"['Abbreviations', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Enzymes', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hyperemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Oklahoma', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Parabiosis', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Rejuvenation', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Vasodilation', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'attenuation', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive function', 'cost estimate', 'density', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neurovascular', 'neurovascular coupling', 'nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'response', 'restoration', 'transcriptomics', 'vascular cognitive impairment and dementia']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,RF1,2021,1361358
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,10112311,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data repository', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,705172
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138
"Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a peak onset during adolescence. While interventions are moderately effective for many adolescents, 40 to 70% will relapse within 5 years. Further, MDD relapse predicts academic difficulties, risky behaviors, and suicide. Thus, identifying mechanisms of MDD relapse is critical to clarify intervention targets for this significant public health problem.  During adolescence, social processes and dynamics (especially with peers) are particularly significant, although it is unclear which social processes are most critical to MDD relapse. The present study focuses on the role of social communication, a set of mechanisms involving the receiving and delivery of socially relevant information. Social communication is especially significant to adolescents, as maladaptive social communication can negatively impact the establishment and maintenance of relationships, thus increasing risk for MDD relapse.  For the proposed study, we will employ an NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) lens and use multiple measures (behavior, event-related potentials [ERPs], eye tracking) to compare adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with remitted depression (remMDD; N=200) to healthy controls (HC; N=100) on deficits in several aspects of social communication, including: (i) processing of nonverbal social information, (ii) processing of socioemotional feedback, and (iii) digital communication. First, Aim 1 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process two types of nonverbal social information—facial expressions (as indexed by reduced accuracy and abnormal ERPs [i.e., the N170]) and hand gesturing behaviors (assessed via eye-tracking). Second, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process socioemotional feedback (being accepted versus rejected by same-aged peers), a well-established trigger of adolescent MDD. Specifically, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit a reduced Late Positive Potential [LPP]), an ERP indexing emotional encoding, following positive social feedback from faux peers during a peer evaluation task. Third, using an innovative smartphone app, Aim 3 will collect multiple indicators of digital communication regarding the structure of adolescents’ digital social network (i.e., size of the network; frequency of communication) and sentiment of the communication with their digital social network (i.e., coding sentiment from their texts, social media posts); allowing us to test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit abnormal digital communication. Last, we will follow adolescents for 1-year to determine whether processing of nonverbal information, social feedback, and digital communication predict the escalation of depression symptoms and MDD relapse. Further, supervised machine learning will explore which social communication deficit(s) predict symptoms or MDD relapse, and whether these social processes predict outcomes independent of (or interaction with) other established predictors of relapse (e.g., stressful life events). In summary, the project has the promise to identify social process that contribute to recurrent depression, which, ultimately, will lead to innovative treatment approaches. Project Narrative Depression in adolescence is common and recurrent. While social processes and dynamics are particularly significant in adolescence, it is unclear which social processes are most critical to depression relapse. The present study uses an RDoC “lens” to examine the role of multiple aspects of social communication to determine which social communication deficit predicts the escalation of depression symptoms and relapse during a 1-year follow-up period.",Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression,10064641,R01MH119771,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Social Network', 'Social Processes', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Youth', 'aged', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'negative affect', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'recurrent depression', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'showing emotion', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,720319
"Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a serious public health concern in the United States. However, despite an increase in theoretical models of and treatments for suicide, the suicide rate has risen 33% since 1999. Given the widespread availability of smartphone technology, there is great potential to deliver interventions via mobile platforms. However, despite the proliferation of smartphone tools for suicide, few offer evidence-based support and some include potentially harmful content. In response, we have conducted initial development of a mobile suicide prevention system: Mobile Application to Prevent Suicide (MAPS). MAPS was specifically designed to identify increased suicide risk and deliver personalized intervention for patients transitioning out of a psychiatric hospital, a time of extraordinarily high risk. MAPS provides both a mobile app and clinician support, and includes multiple evidence-based components: (1) monitoring of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), (2) personalized, interactive coping strategy administration based on participants’ current risk state, (3) direct access to clinicians and crisis support services, and (4) psychoeducation. We will leverage existing components of MAPS and develop and test new features. To plan for sustainability of MAPS, we will deliver the intervention through the Butler Hospital Transitional Outpatient Program, assigning participants to master’s level hospital clinicians, and convene a Stakeholder Advisory Board with a focus on program sustainability. Specifically, the primary aim of this investigation is to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms (i.e., self-monitoring, use of coping strategies, reduction of negative affect, self-efficacy). The ultimate goal of this project is to further develop and refine the MAPS system and engage in preliminary testing in preparation for a fully-powered randomized clinical trial (R01) to establish effectiveness of the intervention in a larger health care system and to further optimize intervention components and delivery (e.g., machine learning techniques). This proposal outlines procedures for intervention and clinician training program refinement through focus groups and open and randomized pilot trials. Thus, the present study is designed to develop the tools, procedures, and knowledge base for a novel intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is a major public health problem, with over 47,000 deaths by suicide per year, and individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitals are at extraordinarily elevated risk for suicide. Currently available treatments for suicide have not led to a decrease in the suicide rate. The primary aim of the present study is leverage existing infrastructure to develop novel technological features for a novel personalized smartphone intervention system, and to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms.","Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide.",10107455,R34MH124971,"['Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognition', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotions', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Professional Practice', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care systems', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'cost', 'critical period', 'design', 'effectiveness study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'outpatient programs', 'personalized care', 'personalized intervention', 'pilot trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIMH,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R34,2021,236986
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,10128438,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'privacy preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,481279
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.  REL EVAN CE (Se e in stru cti ons): The proposed research will develop and field test an innovative computationally-enabled personalized behavior change model that will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and is designed to be integrated into clinical practice.

"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,10128500,R01MH120601,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Antioxidants', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'biobehavior', 'causal model', 'cell type', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'computerized', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pleasure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'reward anticipation', 'reward circuitry', 'sex', 'stressor', 'subthreshold depression']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,786200
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,10142533,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,843511
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,10138024,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,249264
"A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the most critical public health threats. As such there is an urgent need to identify new ways to reduce AMR transmission. In recent years, several studies have started to reveal the complex relations and interactions between antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the human microbiome. The human microbiome plays profound roles in responding to antibiotic treatment and the transmission of ARGs. The altered microbiome, especially in children, may have a distinct resistome (the entire ARGs in the microbiome community). Infants and young children receive frequent antimicrobial courses for common respiratory infections and are thought to spread ARGs effectively in the community. Otitis media is the most common reason for antimicrobial treatment in children. The antibiotic treatment that is selected for use in young children may significantly influence AMR spread in the communities. To date, there are a limited number of prospective, controlled comparative studies on how selected antibiotics affect the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome in young children. It is not possible to investigate children in an experimental way and expose them to antibiotics without an indication for the treatment. Non-severe acute otitis media, however, is an excellent clinical model to investigate the impact of different antimicrobial agents, since clinical guidelines suggest several alternative approaches to treat children, including watchful waiting without antibiotics. In this study, we will investigate the impact of the most commonly used antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, and in particular the resistome in children with otitis media. The Oulu University study is IRB approved and has started enrolling infants and young children with non-severe otitis media in a study cohort and plan to finish the enrollment within the first few months of this project. Children are randomly allocated in four antibiotic treatment groups to compare the impact of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, or no treatment on the intestinal microbiome and ARGs. We will solicit the antibiotic exposure during lifetime and collect stool samples before (day 0) and three days after the antibiotic course (day 10). We will apply quantitative PCR, 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing on different platforms to characterize the microbiome and resistome over time. De novo genome assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads technology, combined with high depth Illumina sequencing will reveal the details of ARGs and gene variants between species, and between microbiome communities, and show us novel mobile elements containing ARGs, which may be potentially transferred horizontally between species. We will apply machine learning approaches to quantitatively study how each bacterial species responds to and survives under antibiotic exposure, by analyzing genomic variants in ARGs, changes in three dimensional structure of the key ARGs, ARG network and pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a growing threat for public health. This proposal involves a randomized, controlled study of how the human microbiome in young children responds to different antimicrobial agents and will reveal possible genomic mechanisms by which this occurs thereby providing insight into potential new approaches to address the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children,10113538,R21AI151730,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Amoxicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Azithromycin', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Clavulanate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Otitis Media', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Pattern', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'clinical care', 'colonization resistance', 'design', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'fecal microbiome', 'genetic variant', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'insight', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'randomized controlled study', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'stool sample', 'three dimensional structure', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment group']",NIAID,"J.

"The Pathophysiological Role of Cerebellar Glia in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rett  syndrome  (RTT)  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  intellectual  disability  in  girls  and  women.  Individuals  with  RTT  develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  and  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2  (MECP2)  occur  in  >95%  of  RTT  cases.  Initially,  researchers  regarded  MeCP2  deficiency  in  neurons  as  the  exclusive  cause  of  RTT.  However,  recent  studies  have  revealed  that  glia  have  a  pathological  role  in  RTT  etiology. Studies have not yet uncovered the underlying cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction in Mecp2  rodent  models  or  the  impact  of  this  dysfunction  on  brain  function.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution  of  a  specific  glial  subtype,  Bergmann  glia  cells  (BGs)  in  the  cerebellum,  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT.  We  will  focus  on  BGs  because  (1)  cerebellar  disruption  likely  contributes  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT  and  (2)  BGs  are  the  major  glial  subtype  in  the  cerebellum.  We  propose  to  characterize  cerebellar  function  in  conditional  knockout  (cKO)  mice  that  lack  Mecp2  in  BGs  using  a  repertoire  of  approaches,  including  intracellular  whole-­cell  recordings,  in  vivo  recordings  of  single  units  and  local  field  potentials,  in  vivo  and  ex  vivo  imaging  of  genetically-­encoded  Ca2+,  glutamate,  and  dopamine  (DA)  sensors  (GCaMP7,  iGluSnFr,  and  dLight1.1,  respectively),  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  near  super-­resolution  confocal  microscopy,  and  behavioral  assessments  using  unbiased  machine-­learning  approaches.  Our  preliminary results indicate deficits in BGs from Mecp2-­deficient mice, including higher expression levels of the  GluA1  subunit  of  AMPA  receptors  (AMPARs),  and  depolarized  membrane  potentials.  In  addition,  we  have  preliminary evidence of DAergic modulation of BGs through the activation of D1 receptors (D1Rs) activated by  either electrical or optogenetic stimulation of DAergic inputs to the cerebellum. Of high relevance to motor and  social symptoms in RTT, the expression levels of D1Rs, which modulate GluA1 surface insertion, are higher in  Mecp2  KO  mice.  We  hypothesize  that  BGs  in  the  cerebellum  have  a  pathophysiological  role  in  motor  and  social  deficits  in  Mecp2-­deficient  mice.  We  propose  two  Aims:  (1)  Define  cerebellar  BG  dysfunction  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice;;  (2)  Characterize  DAergic  modulation  of  cerebellar  BGs  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice.  The  proposed  studies  will elucidate the consequences of impaired DAergic modulation of astrocyte function on cerebellar-­dependent  behaviors,  which  will  have  broad  implications  not  only  for  RTT  but  also  for  other  brain  disorders  associated  with cerebellar dysfunction.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by MECP2 mutations, presents with stereotypic hand movements, ambulatory difficulties, and social impairments. Dysfunctional interactions between glial cells and neurons and their modulation by dopamine may play crucial pathological roles in developing neurological symptoms.

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond. This project continues a successful program of research on the brain mechanisms of placebo effects, taking the work in new directions critical for understanding mental health.",The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes,10056222,R01MH076136,"['Acupuncture Therapy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Conceptions', 'Deception', 'Disease', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Naloxone', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wages', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical pain', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal function', 'improved', 'negative affect', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'patient expectation', 'placebo analgesia', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'social interventions', 'social model', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,740565
"Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of Americans, and also causes significant economic costs to the nation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms through which CVD develops is of paramount importance if we are to successfully identify those at risk for CVD, and intervene to ultimately prevent CVD-related death and economic impact. Psychological stress reactivity has long been appreciated as a risk factor for negative CVD- related outcomes, and recent work suggests that inflammatory reactivity to stress is a critical biological mechanism through which stress increases risk for CVD. However, there are significant gaps in our current knowledge regarding the neural predictors and molecular pathways through which stress leads to inflammation. These knowledge gaps are critical to fill if we are to develop a full mechanistic understanding of how stress leads to CVD risk, and may also shed light on future intervention targets. Thus, the present project will use cutting- edge computational methods to identify neural signatures of stress-related inflammatory reactivity, and will use pharmacological tools to block an important stress-signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) and examine its effects on neural and inflammatory reactivity to stress. Study 1 (N=100) will use fMRI to examine neural responses to a social evaluative stress task, with blood samples taken before and after the stressor assayed for pro-inflammatory gene expression and circulating inflammatory proteins. We will use innovative multivariate machine learning analytic techniques to identify the neural patterns that predict changes in inflammation, as well as network-based analytic tools from mathematics to examine how large-scale brain networks change configuration in response to stress in ways that are linked to inflammation. In Study 2 (N=120), we will conduct a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol to examine how blocking beta-adrenergic signaling impacts neural and inflammatory responses to the social evaluative stress task. Together, these two studies will allow us to establish the neural signatures of stress-induced increases in inflammation (Aim 1), determine the effects of beta-adrenergic signaling on neural responses to stress (Aim 2), and examine the neural mediators of beta-adrenergic related attenuations in stress-related inflammatory reactivity (Aim 3). In doing so, this project will ultimately help identify neural signatures of risk for stress-related inflammation, as well as novel targets for future intervention to ameliorate the impact of stress on the brain and body and reduce the health and economic burden of CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE What are the neural and molecular mechanisms through which psychological stress leads to an inflammatory response, thus increasing risk for cardiovascular disease? The present project will use neuroimaging and pharmacological tools to answer this question, exploring the neural activity patterns and brain network configuration in response to stress that is associated with increases in inflammation, as well as how experimentally blocking one important stress signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) shapes neural and inflammatory responses to stress. Ultimately, these studies will fill critical gaps in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which stress may lead to cardiovascular disease risk, and help to identify novel targets for future interventions.",Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses,10185562,R01HL157422,"['Acute', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Affective', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Propranolol', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'attenuation', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'computational neuroscience', 'cytokine', 'double-blind placebo controlled trial', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'health economics', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social genomics', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,621869
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Optimizing Exercise for the Treatment of Anxiety PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Anxiety disorders are impairing and amongst the most common psychiatric conditions; yet, many impacted individuals do not receive or respond to evidence-based care. There is thus a great need to develop and optimize additional first-line, more accessible interventions for anxiety disorders. Exercise has benefits for anxiety and physical health, without many of the side effects, accessibility issues, or costs of medications or psychotherapy. However, adherence to exercise recommendations is low, and even worse for high intensity exercise (HIE) in individuals with anxiety disorders. This may be due to high anxiety sensitivity (AS), or fear of anxiety-related physiological sensations, as HIE may induce similar sensations. There are, however, no formal guidelines for optimal intensity or titration of exercise for any mental health condition, and it remains unclear whether exercise requires slower titration for optimal tolerability and response for anxiety.  In order to develop exercise as a formally prescribed intervention for anxiety disorders in a way that enhances engagement and adherence, research is needed to guide optimal titration of exercise prescriptions, and to establish mechanisms that should be targeted to optimize outcomes in practice. Addressing these gaps, this study will examine the impact of exercise titration on AS/anxiety symptom severity as well as engagement and adherence. Specifically, 90 sedentary adults with a primary anxiety disorder and moderate to high AS will be randomized to either 8 weeks of 1) low intensity exercise, or 2) flexible titration to HIE. Blinded, validated clinician-rated and patient-rated outcomes will be assessed over treatment and at 1- and 3-month follow-up. To better understand what mechanisms influence decisions to exercise in the real-world, and novel to this research and key training goals, are the use of heart rate (HR) as an objective mechanistic target for exercise intensity, examining changes in valuation of exercise through a neuroeconomics task, and the integration of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure effects of immediate changes in mood with exercise on anxiety outcomes and adherence. Additional training goals will support the analysis of study data with state-of- the-art advanced statistical techniques such as growth curve modelling and machine learning.  The scientific aims of this study map onto my training plan in three primary areas: 1) applying an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, integrating an objective target mechanism (HR) and transdiagnostic AS, 2) examining EMA data with HR to identify real time drivers of engagement and response outside the office setting, and 3) applying advanced computational psychiatry techniques to data analysis. Related training goals will enable integration of neuroeconomic human decision-making models into the current study and integral training in neural mechanisms of action to support future R-level proposals. Finally, mentorship from Drs. Simon (primary mentor), Abrantes (Co-mentor), and Glimcher, Jay, Laska, and Pine (advisors) will propel me toward an independent research career focused on optimizing exercise interventions for mental health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exercise offers great potential as a first-line, formally prescribed intervention for anxiety disorders, but research is needed to improve exercise engagement, establish the optimal titration for exercise prescriptions, and identify which mechanisms to target to optimize outcomes in practice. This Career Development Award project examines a novel exercise titration method as compared to low intensity exercise with objective assessment of heart rate based intensity goals (as target engagement), assessment of real-time changes in mood following exercise (through ecological momentary assessment), neuroeconomic assessment of exercise decision-making, and their association with anxiety and adherence outcomes in sedentary individuals with a primary anxiety disorder and moderate to high anxiety sensitivity. Findings will inform optimal exercise titration methods as well as identify potential mechanisms to support the development of personalized approaches to prescribing exercise as an evidence-based intervention for anxiety.",Optimizing Exercise for the Treatment of Anxiety,10127242,K23MH122773,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Esthesia', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Maximum Heart Rate', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Severities', 'Sports Medicine', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Work', 'anxiety sensitivity', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'career', 'college', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'exercise intensity', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise prescription', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuroeconomics', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'personalized approach', 'physical conditioning', 'positive mood', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'sedentary', 'side effect']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2021,178726
"Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescents experience escalating risk for developing clinical depression, which can lead to lifelong morbidity and mortality. The neural, physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that may contribute to this risk also signal an opportunity for high impact intervention. Unfortunately, psychotherapy trials demonstrate modest effects on youth depression. To improve long-term outcomes for adolescents, this study will identify person- specific drivers of adolescent depression that can guide treatment personalization. Prior research with depressed or anxious adults demonstrates the existence of such drivers—symptoms and related processes that are influential (i.e., predict change in other symptoms), modifiable, and exhibit individual differences. Personalized selection and sequencing of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules to target these drivers early in adults have produced larger treatment effects compared to a historical benchmark. Identifying person- specific drivers during adolescence could inform treatments that account for both developmental and individual differences to shift the trajectory of depression onset and maintenance. Investigating person-specific drivers usually involves intensive surveying of self-reported experience via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Emerging evidence suggests that smartphones can also monitor mood through passive sensing of depression-related behaviors with minimal response burden. However, nearly all such studies have been conducted with adults, despite near universal smartphone ownership among adolescents in the US. Thus, this study will leverage depressed adolescents' everyday smartphone use to assess the validity of mobile sensing against established ambulatory methods (i.e., EMA and actigraphy) to identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression. Fifty adolescents (12–18 years old) with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in 30 days of: a) smartphone-based EMA of depressive symptoms, processes, and affect (4x/day), sleep diary (1x/day); (b) mobile sensing of mobility, physical activity, sleep, natural language use in typed interpersonal communication, screen-on time and call frequency/duration; and (c) wrist actigraphy of physical activity and sleep. Adolescents and caregivers will complete diagnostic interviews and other measures (e.g., developmental, clinical, Research Domain Criteria) at baseline, as well as user feedback interviews at follow- up. To address study aims: 1) idiographic, within-subject networks of EMA symptoms will be modeled to identify each adolescent's drivers; 2) correlations among EMA, mobile sensor, and actigraph measures of sleep, physical, and social activity; and machine learning prediction of core depressive symptoms (self- reported mood and anhedonia) will be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying person- specific drivers; 3) between-subject baseline characteristics will be explored as predictors of person-specific drivers. These results will inform future development of a scalable, low-burden smartphone-based tool that can guide personalized treatment decisions for depressed adolescents, with potential public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescence is marked by escalating risk for developing clinical depression, but also presents an optimal window for high impact intervention to alter the course of this often disabling disorder. To inform future efforts to personalize psychological interventions for depressed adolescents and maximize their efficacy, the proposed study will identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression—influential and modifiable symptoms and processes that exhibit individual differences—and demonstrate the validity of using a smartphone tool to identify these person-specific drivers. The proposed study will generate data to inform the development of a scalable, low-burden, smartphone-based tool to guide treatment decisions, with potential public health impact given near-universal smartphone ownership among adolescents across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the US.",Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data,10196290,R21MH126394,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Communication', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'anxious', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diaries', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'network models', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'racial and ethnic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,198257
"Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children Project Summary: While strong empirical evidence shows that exposure to food advertisements increases short-term food intake and contributes to the development of obesity, not all children are susceptible to this effect. Identifying the characteristics that protect some children from overeating in response to food advertising is a public health priority that may highlight novel targets for childhood obesity prevention. We propose to use state-of-the art, data driven techniques to identify neural, cognitive and behavioral phenotypes that are associated with resiliency to food-cue induced overeating and determine whether these phenotypes protect children from weight gain during the critical pre-adolescent period. The driving premise of this proposal is that children who are resistant to food-cue induced overeating will exhibit a distinct cluster of neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits which protect them from weight gain in an obesogenic environment. Our preliminary studies suggest that greater neural activation in prefrontal cortical regions implicated in cognitive control, increased executive functioning, and lower food advertising exposure may be some of the characteristics that confer resiliency to overeating in response to food advertising cues. To confirm our preliminary findings, we plan to enroll 140, 7-8 year-old children with healthy weight who vary by risk for obesity (70 low-risk/both parents with healthy weight; 70 high-risk/both parents with obesity) for a 1-year prospective study. In aim one, we will compare the effect of exposing children to commercials (i.e., food, toy, and non-rewarding advertisements) on subsequent neural activation and network connectivity characteristics in response to viewing high-energy food cues. We hypothesize that exposure to food commercials (vs. toy and non-food) will reduce prefrontal cortex activation, but that there will be substantial variability in this response across children. In aim two, we will determine how food commercials affect children’s subsequent food intake at both homeostatic (i.e., ad libitum test-meals) and non-homeostatic (i.e., eating palatable snacks when not hungry) eating events and relate these responses to underlying neural circuitry. In aim three, we will test the extent to which children’s executive function and prior food advertising experience moderate the relationship between food commercial exposure and subsequent neural and behavioral outcomes. In the final aim, we will use sophisticated data-driven techniques (i.e., machine learning) to identify neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of familial risk status on weight-gain. We expect the proposed studies to inform the science of obesity prevention by identifying specific modifiable phenotypes that protect high-risk children from excess weight gain during the pre-adolescent period. The overall impact of these studies will be to identify novel neural and behavioral characteristics of resiliency to food advertising in children. It will be the first to focus specifically on characterizing neural resiliency factors associated with decreased risk of food-cue induced eating and determine the extent to which these factors protect pre-adolescent children from the development of obesity. Project Narrative: Reducing excess food consumption in response to food advertising is a public health goal for preventing excess weight gain and the development of obesity in children. Food marketing is a major contributor to childhood obesity, and the proposed research will identify neurobiological and behavioral characteristics that protect some children from overeating in the presence of this cue. These findings will have direct implications for the development of more effective strategies to reduce energy intake for the prevention of obesity.",Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children,10049781,R01DK126050,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Energy', 'Foundations', 'Hyperphagia', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention program', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure of postcentral gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toy', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'design', 'eating in absence of hunger', 'excessive weight gain', 'executive function', 'experience', 'food consumption', 'food marketing', 'health goals', 'healthy weight', 'hedonic', 'high risk', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'preadolescence', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'trait']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,603724
"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies.

"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.’s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group’s online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH’s focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success.

"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers.

"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,10200044,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2021,183893
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10083111,R01MH118220,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cervical spine', 'Clinical', 'Confusion', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Models', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Department-based Intervention', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Standard', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychologist', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Direction', 'Stratification', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'common rule', 'cost', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic evaluation', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care economics', 'high risk', 'implementation barriers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,814463
"Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K23 proposal seeks to provide an early-career clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (Dr. Alexander Weigard) with the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent patient- oriented investigator focused on using advanced computational methods to elucidate etiological mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUDs) and generate meaningful predictions for patients. The candidate will work towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused on assessing whether two advanced computational methods can facilitate the selection of features from neuroscientific data that are relevant for the individualized prediction of SUD risk in youth. Although extant research in developmental neuroscience has identified multiple early risk factors that are associated with development of SUD at the group level, there is currently a dearth of large scale, replicable research in which neurocognitive data are used to make reliable and generalizable predictions of SUD outcomes for individual youth. In the proposed project, the candidate will combine his existing expertise in computational models of cognition with new training in predictive informatics methods to assess whether two advanced computational approaches, a) sequential sampling models (SSMs) of cognition and b) network neuroscience, can be used to extract features from longitudinal neurocognitive data that enhance the prediction of youths’ SUD outcomes. The candidate will conduct extensive analyses with two large data sets (Michigan Longitudinal Study, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study) and collect pilot data with 60 young adults to accomplish the following research aims: 1) Quantify the added benefit of SSM parameters for improving the performance of multivariate SUD prediction models, and 2) Identify the multivariate neural signature of v, an SSM parameter with promising links to substance use, and determine the potential of this signature for predicting a precursor to SUD (substance use initiation in mid-adolescence) in ABCD and differentiating young adults with SUDs in the newly-collected pilot sample. Completion of the following training objectives will ensure that the candidate can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent investigator who is well-equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Mastering principles of machine learning model development and testing in longitudinal data sets, 2) building expertise in using multivariate network neuroscience methods for feature selection and prediction, 3) increasing clinical and epidemiological knowledge of SUD risk factors beyond neurocognition, and 4) improving professional skills necessary to become an independent patient-oriented investigator. The proposed K23 aims to take a crucial step towards the development of advanced computational neuroscience methods that may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying reliable predictors of individuals’ SUD risk, and to set the candidate up to independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Decades of developmental neuroscience research have illuminated multiple factors that convey risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs) at the group level, but the field currently lacks methods for using neurocognitive data to make accurate and generalizable predictions about SUD risk for individual youth. The proposed project seeks to address this critical gap in the field by providing an early-career scientist with the tools and training necessary to test whether the combination of two advanced computational approaches, sequential sampling models of cognitive functioning and network neuroscience methods, improve the accuracy of multivariate predictive models of individuals’ SUD risk.

"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,10204721,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,411713
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,10187663,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,75097
"Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Converging evidence has linked the habenula (Hb), a small epithalamic structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling, to a wide range of affective, motivational, and motor functions. Abnormalities in Hb circuitry are increasingly implicated in psychiatric and behavioral disorders. In vivo Hb research has proceeded slowly, however, due to technical constraints in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that make it difficult to define and characterize this small region. Understanding of the Hb is especially limited in adolescence, a critical period marked by rapid maturation of the reward system and, often, the first emergence of psychiatric disorders. To address these gaps in basic and clinical neuroscience, our proposal leverages the unprecedented scale and quality of high-resolution neuroimaging data available through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the development of Hb function in early adolescence and its role in psychiatric illness onset. The proposed research builds on extensive work by our group to develop and refine Hb imaging methodology, including automated segmentation and a region of interest optimization approach that significantly improves Hb fMRI sensitivity, and is supported by substantial data from our laboratory. In independent samples of adult and adolescent healthy controls (HCs), we found a highly consistent pattern of positive Hb intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), downstream nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cortical salience network (SN), as well as negative Hb iFC throughout the default mode network (DMN). Adults with high vs. low subclinical depression scores exhibited distinct iFC patterns with regions associated with anxiety and depression, including the amygdala and insula. Moreover, adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders had positive Hb iFC with the DMN, and this abnormal Hb-DMN iFC pattern was associated with anxiety severity across both healthy and clinical adolescents, while hyperconnectivity with SN and other expected Hb targets correlated with anhedonia. Building on our compelling findings to date, we propose to study Hb function at Baseline and Year 2 ABCD neuroimaging timepoints in relation to normative (Aim 1) and clinical (Aim 2) developmental trajectories. Subjects will comprise two cohorts of ~3000 adolescents each: clinical subjects, with significant past or current mood and anxiety symptoms, and HCs, with no history of psychiatric diagnoses or clinically significant symptoms. Study procedures will incorporate sophisticated preprocessing and denoising, optimized subject-level Hb definition, neuroanatomically accurate cortical surface mapping, and rigorous non-parametric statistics. Analyses will encompass both resting-state and task fMRI to characterize Hb iFC and activation during specific reward, loss, and inhibitory control processes. We will examine both group differences and associations with psychiatric symptom severity using hypothesis-driven as well as machine learning approaches.  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to advance basic and clinical neuroscientific understanding of the habenula, a small structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling and is increasingly implicated in psychiatric disorders. The technical difficulty of studying the habenula has limited in vivo research, especially in adolescent populations where psychiatric symptoms often first emerge. Using an optimize analysis approach and a large sample of high- resolution neuroimaging data from the ABCD study, we propose to comprehensively investigate habenula function in normative early adolescent development and in the onset and trajectory of adolescent mental illness.",Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study,10234369,R21MH126501,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Health', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epithalamic structure', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habenula', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'animal data', 'anxiety symptoms', 'automated segmentation', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'denoising', 'early adolescence', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'subclinical depression', 'tv watching']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,210000
"The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants PROJECT SUMMARY  Infancy is increasingly being recognized as a key time point of microbiome establishment that impacts neonatal health as well as later outcomes. The intestinal microbiome has specifically been implicated in neurologic outcomes via the gut-brain axis. However, means by which the intestinal microbiome can have influence on the brain are poorly understood. The preterm infant is at the nexus of these unknowns. Preterm infants are a vulnerable patient population at risk for significant poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Preterm infant brain development occurs in parallel with intestinal microbiome development, thus modification of the intestinal microbiome is a potential means of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that distinct gut microbiome taxa and metabolites at key time points improve preterm infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age.  Our preliminary and published data in gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that different early preterm infant microbiota impact neuron number, myelination, and behavior. This proposal will use our ongoing MIND (Microbiome In Neonatal Development) preterm infant cohort to determine how the gut microbiome impacts neurodevelopmental potential in the NICU, and how it may alter neurodevelopmental trajectories post- NICU discharge. We will conduct longitudinal sampling of participant fecal and blood samples to monitor gut microbiome as well as fecal and serum metabolites. We will also perform neurodevelopmental testing during the NICU course and up until preschool/school age (3.5-5 years old). School readiness, which describes children's strengths, challenges, and needs for supports when learning in the classroom, is a functional outcome that differs from single summary measures of intelligence (IQ) and will be the outcome measure.  A combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics and metabonomics will be applied to the collected fecal samples. Sophisticated machine learning strategies will be used to develop novel models of preterm infant gut microbiome succession with time as a critical element. Serum cytokine analysis and metabonomics will provide mechanistic insight into how the gut microbiome may be impacting neurodevelopment. We have established complementary in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models, in which germ-free mice are transfaunated with preterm infant microbiota. This state-of-the-art experimental model will allow specific investigation of the impact of clinically relevant microbiota on brain development that is not possible in human infants. The goal of this proposal is to discover intestinal microbiome patterns associated with school readiness, identify the key time points that represent windows of opportunity for microbiome optimization, and identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome impacts brain development and behavior. This new knowledge will enhance our understanding of the gut-brain axis and lay the foundation for microbial based therapeutics to improve infant neurodevelopmental trajectories. PROJECT NARRATIVE The intestinal microbiome has impact beyond the gut and the existence of a gut-brain axis has been proposed. Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This proposal will study how the changes in bacterial colonization patterns of preterm infants over time from birth until school age impact brain development, and thus school readiness and learning for these vulnerable infants.",The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants,10200392,R01HD105234,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '5 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genes', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurons', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut-brain axis', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy design']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,705079
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,10197781,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,587831
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,10171753,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2021,740671
"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,10054973,R01MH115922,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'Violence', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'individual response', 'men', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'physical abuse', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,670430
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. This prospective matched cohort study explores the cognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance. The goal is to inform care and advice to return to safe driving among young drivers following a recent concussion.",Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver,10173921,R01NS107459,"['Acceleration', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohols', 'Attention Concentration', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Police', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recreation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Young driver', 'aged', 'base', 'case control', 'classification trees', 'cognitive task', 'cohort', 'concussive symptom', 'distracted driving', 'driving safety', 'driving skills', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitness', 'functional improvement', 'impaired driving performance', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mortality risk', 'new technology', 'population health', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'processing speed', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risky driving', 'skills', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,491423
"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10265540,R01ES031411,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All-Trans-Retinol', 'Antioxidants', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Arylesterase', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Carotenoids', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tocopherols', 'Urine', 'Uruguay', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'aged', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'aryldialkylphosphatase', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'early adolescence', 'environmental chemical', 'enzyme activity', 'executive function', 'experience', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'glutathione peroxidase', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'middle childhood', 'oxidative DNA damage', 'pyrethroid', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'urinary']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,543551
"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study,10173881,R01HL152740,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ancillary Study', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Trauma', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Common Ventricle', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Heart', 'Hemosiderin', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Translational trial', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'aged', 'brain abnormalities', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'executive function', 'hypoxic ischemic injury', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'randomized trial', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'translational study', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,425096
"COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has manifested in children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to devastating acute respiratory symptoms, appendicitis (often with rupture), and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15 million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and computational approaches to identify both population- and individual-level risk factors for severe illness. Our underlying hypothesis is that a combination of multidimensional data – clinical, sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and biological -- can be integrated to predict which children are at greatest risk to have severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants) and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks, including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim 3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community and environmental contexts, and informed by the REASSURED framework specified by the RFA. The models and biomarkers developed through our nationwide network of networks will produce generalizable knowledge that will improve our ability to predict which children are at greatest risk for severe complications of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. This knowledge will facilitate interventions to prevent and treat severe pediatric illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide public health problem. Pediatric disease has been particularly difficult to manage since children tend less frequently to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but, when they do become ill, can present with life-threatening pulmonary disease or a systemic inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The proposed COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) will develop models and biomarkers that predict risk for severe disease in children and adolescents by systematically integrating social science, epidemiological, genetic, biochemical, immunological, and computational approaches.",COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children),10273971,R61HD105619,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Appendicitis', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RADx', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Social Sciences', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Health Resources and Services Administration', 'Virus', 'base', 'case control', 'case finding', 'coronavirus disease', 'data resource', 'developmental disease', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'saliva sample', 'severe COVID-19', 'social', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'translational approach']",NICHD,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R61,2021,840235
"A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to PAR-20-237, “community interventions to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among health disparity and vulnerable populations,” we propose to study a parent-focused mentalizing intervention with a smartphone health platform in vulnerable populations in the Bronx. The Bronx—the poorest borough in New York City (NYC) with 84% of its population comprised of minorities—has been hit disproportionally by the COVID-19 pandemic. For caregivers in the Bronx, the pandemic has caused unprecedented psychological distress; in addition to combating social determinants of health (SDOH), these families now face greater financial insecurity and challenges related to their school-aged children. Furthermore, social distancing requirements and limited telehealth resources for Bronx families have posed greater barriers to healthcare. Such parental distress contributes to heightened risk of transgenerational cycles of psychological stress, trauma and maltreatment. Addressing these challenges, we propose a multimodal study tackling both parental vulnerability and healthcare access. a) Targeting parental vulnerability, we propose to build upon our 12-session therapeutic CARE program, which utilizes Mentalization Based Therapy and designed for parents of children in treatment in a community psychiatry clinic in our health system. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of attachment-based parenting interventions, including from our group in disadvantaged cohorts from the Bronx. b) Targeting healthcare access, we propose to utilize the HIPAA-compliant and IRB-approved Valera Health smartphone application (“app”), which has been studied in our health system in selected cohorts and resulted in greater access to healthcare. Building upon our work and clinical infrastructure, we hypothesize that both the CARE program and the Valera app will mitigate the psychological effects of COVID-19 while enhancing access to healthcare in the Bronx. The study will take place at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), the largest health system in the Bronx, which serves predominantly racial and ethnic minority individuals from underserved families. We will focus on three highly vulnerable cohorts: a) caregivers of children with psychiatric conditions (N=130); b) caregivers of children with autoimmune illnesses (N=130), and; c) caregivers who are frontline healthcare workers at MMC (N=100); all presenting with moderate stress. A RCT with 4 arms (2 x 2 design) will test our hypothesis: a) CARE program alone; b) CARE program + Valera app; c) Parent Education (PE) alone; d) PE + Valera app. Smartphones and connectivity will be provided as needed. Surveys at study enrollment, 6-, 12- and 24-weeks will assess parental stress, mentalizing capacity (reflective functioning), access to healthcare, mood and anxiety and additional parent and child clinical measures. Machine learning approaches will explore complex patterns as predictors of outcome including COVID-19 illness/deaths, medical comorbidity, housing, poverty, psychopathology, age, family functioning, and trauma. Impact. This multimodal study addresses key strategies to mitigate the psychological and health impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Our proposed prospective research, focusing on examining the effectiveness of both a telehealth platform and an innovative treatment approach for parents and primary caregivers as well as frontline healthcare providers who are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to provide support to these highly vulnerable groups based in the Bronx who normally encounter significant barriers to basic care. If successful, the study has the potential to offset several of the negative social determinants of health typically encountered by members of these vulnerable communities. As such, the clinical implications of our proposed research are potentially profound.",A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx,10261854,R01MH126821,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Autoimmune Process', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'maltreatment', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'perceived stress', 'primary caregiver', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial minority', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'social health determinants', 'substance use treatment', 'telehealth', 'therapy design']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,50000
"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,10145795,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Energy Supply', 'Esthesia', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fasting', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hematology', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Ploidies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Chain', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'allostatic load', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomarker signature', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'negative affect', 'negative mood', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'stress reactivity', 'trait', 'urinary']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,764882
"Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark’s population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD and mortality later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis- generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk.

"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk.

"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",10158509,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,2152577
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,10197069,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,679645

"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,10164863,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2021,694636
"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",10020446,R01MH126639,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,391250
"Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease Abstract This proposal is designed to extend and complement our R01-funded case-cohort study of cadmium (Cd) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein we will add arsenic (As), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) to our case-cohort study and include epidemiologic and toxicologic mixtures analyses. The four elements we have selected are compelling for their independent role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a mixture. As increases plaque formation and adhesion to endothelium and Cd also induces endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis; yet it is not clear if the effects of As and Cd are synergistic or competing. To potentially counteract these processes, Mg is important for modulating endothelial function. While Ca’s role is equivocal, its role in calcification of the arteries is undeniable, making it important to consider as well. Our efficient case-cohort study design includes 810 cases of AMI and a comparison subcohort of 600 men and 600 women selected randomly from never smokers at risk of AMI at the start of follow-up, leveraging the prospective population-based Danish Diet Cancer and Health Cohort. We are already funded to measure Cd, creatinine, osmolality, and cotinine in baseline urine samples. We now propose to additionally analyze As species, Mg, and Ca in urine among ~2000 participants selected into this case-cohort study, along with pre-existing food frequency questionnaire data on Mg and Ca. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the association between each of As, Ca, and Mg, and incidence of AMI. This will be one of the largest prospective studies of these elements in relation to AMI. In Aim 2 we will apply mixtures methods (Bayesian kernel machine regression, weighted quantile sum regression, random forests) to evaluate the interactive and joint effects of Cd, As, Ca, and Mg in relation to AMI risk. In Aim 3 we will apply in vitro and in vivo approaches to study combined effects of exposure to these elements to investigate the toxicologic mechanisms and pathways of activity. Each Aim is independently compelling and will provide important scientific contributions but together the complementary approaches have the potential to provide evidence of consistency in findings across the distinct approaches. Triangulating data across in vitro, in vivo and epidemiologic analyses represents a translational bridge as depicted in the NIEHS translational research framework. The scope of this virtual consortium will enrich our understanding of the relationships between Cd, As, Mg, Ca, and CVD. Other innovative features of our study include leveraging an existing efficient case-cohort design, large sample size, a large number of incident AMI events, controlling for tobacco smoking, in vitro assays of pro-atherogenic mechanisms, and in vivo studies of atherosclerosis. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of CVD. Public Health Relevance Mechanistic and epidemiologic studies suggest a mixture of elements including cadmium, arsenic, magnesium, and calcium may play an important role in cardiovascular disease as risk and protective factors. We propose to create a virtual consortium to study chemical mixtures of these elements in relation to risk of cardiovascular disease using state-of-the-art techniques in exposure science, epidemiology, biostatistics, and cardio-toxicology. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.",Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease,10254343,R01ES030938,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adhesions', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arsenic', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cadmium', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Cotinine', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lipids', 'Magnesium', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nutrient', 'Osmolalities', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Questionnaires', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxicology', 'Translational Research', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'calcification', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and cancer', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'men', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'never smoker', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,601096
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,10149410,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,733897
"Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups Abstract A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research. The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time- consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies. Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression. Narrative The primary goal of this project is to use network analyses to construct a Feeding Interaction Network using automated feeding data collected from animals living in large breeding groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. If successful, these models will identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of fighting and injury. The application of automated feeding data in the social management of captive colonies of rhesus macaques represents a paradigm shift from more conventional practices.",Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups,10090122,R24OD030035,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Breeding', 'Case Study', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Ovulation', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primates', 'Progesterone', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'affiliative behavior', 'animal resource', 'behavior observation', 'cohesion', 'feeding', 'fighting', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'network models', 'pregnant', 'reproductive', 'season of birth', 'social', 'social attachment', 'social relationships', 'social unrest', 'wound']",OD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2021,802738
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use.

"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,10199050,R01LM012974,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Semantics', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'behavior change', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'digital', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'network models', 'nicotine patch', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'supervised learning', 'virtual coach']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,343235

"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10122993,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579032
"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW. The study aims to achieve a number of outcomes: (1) Acquire refreshed data from all existing MSDW data sources; (2) Use the wide array of data sources stored in MSDW to advance the prediction of suicide mortality, while controlling for data quality and potential model bias; (3) Explore various uses cases of the MSDW such as unsupervised clustering of suicide mortality cases; and, (4) Collaborate with external investigators to validate the MSDW-derived predictive models of suicide death. ❖ PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Close to 48,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2017 and rates have increased 33% since 1999.

"Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media 2/12/2019 ProjectSummary - Google Docs Project Summary I will leverage social media conversations, specifically Reddit, to examine treatment help-seeking at an unprecedented scale, thereby collecting evidence “in the wild” as a new strategy to monitor and respond to the opioid crisis through the following aims. Aim 1. Data Driven Characterization of Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users: I will systematically identify Reddit posts about opioids, identify if the post is help-seeking for treatment, and contextualize the content of help-seeking posts. Aim 2. Data Driven Characterization of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to understand how peers organically respond to help-seeking for treatment by building data-driven models to discern what attributes of posts are predictive of receiving a response from a peer and to examine the typical content and reciprocity of responses. Aim 3. Assess the Quality of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to identify the types of treatment, treatment services, and treatment referral services that are provided in the responses and assess the quality of lay responses to opioid treatment help-seeking. Currently, little is known about how drug users engage social media to support or combat their addictions. Reddit is the sixth most popular website in the US with many reporters noting that it may be the last lifeline for opioid users. Yet, little has been done to tap this potential source for social media monitoring, especially given the difficulty of finding self-identified opioid users who are already contemplating strategies to treat their addiction. This study adds a new significant perspective to social media monitoring and will be among the first in public health to consider social media conversation threads by assessing unique posts about opioid help-seeking, the responses these posts get, and the quality of responses to addiction help-seeking, thereby creating a knowledge base for public health leaders to respond. Success of these aims will generate a number of future research directions that will support interventions that address the needs of self-identified opioid users seeking help on Reddit. Moreover, within all three aims this study will bring significant methodological advances to the study of social media around substance use with the aims relying heavily on automated approaches and analysis first developed in the computational sciences engendering more data scientists to join public health to create actionable knowledge. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4XHd63xhPZT8OFf9bHQ2q6XHpYp_c4AbouAOtAC3SU/edit 1/1 2/12/2019 ProjectNarrative - Google Docs Project Narrative An explosion of surveillance tools fueled by big media data (including social media) is changing public health. These data reveal what a person is thinking/doing and when they are thinking/doing it based on the content and timing of their public posts, providing an assessment of organic help-seeking for addiction and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing that was never before possible. I will extract actionable intelligence from social media data, specifically Reddit, to support more agile, responsive opioid intervention research by studying (a) treatment help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, (b) lay responses to help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, and (c) whether lay peers link self-identified opioid users to evidence-based treatment, treatment services, or treatment referral services. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyIXTdDAbFSkCe81q6hThDiZzKGCXkCy8npWgzr5wfM/edit 1/1",Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media,10137210,K25DA049944,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Code', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Drug user', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Hotlines', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Social intelligence', 'Source', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'combat', 'dissemination trial', 'evidence base', 'help-seeking behavior', 'illicit opioid', 'knowledge base', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'peer', 'phrases', 'posters', 'prescription opioid', 'public health intervention', 'referral services', 'research study', 'response', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K25,2021,189498
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,10213601,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,186147
"Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning The young child’s ability to regulate stress sets the foundation for a host of developmental outcomes, and the parent-infant relationship is the primary context in which stress regulation capacities first develop. Prior research underscores how parents’ own stress may lead to disturbances in parent-infant co-regulation of stress. Given the immense disruptions to family life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand the degree to which COVID-related stress may impact the parent-infant relationship and ultimately infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes. We posit here that (a) maternal stress due to the pandemic will be associated with disturbances in the mother-infant relationship, particularly with respect to mother-infant co- regulation of infant distress and (b) mothers’ experiences of COVID-related stress will have an indirect effect on infant neurobehavioral outcomes, in part, due to disturbances to the mother-infant relationship. We also aim to investigate risk factors (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms, substance use; infant negative emotionality) that might exacerbate such linkages, as well as protective factors (e.g., maternal social support, coping) that may attenuate them. We will partner with six sites from the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study- Phase 1 (New York University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute) that will permit addressing the proposed aims among a geographically diverse sample of 240 families with infants between 6 and 18 months of age. To assess key constructs relevant to mother-infant relationship disturbance, we will use a novel multimodal sensing platform that captures infant vocalizations, stress physiology, and motor behavior, and we will employ machine learn approaches to these multimodal data to yield automated assessments of mother-infant co-regulation of infant distress. By combining assessments of (a) mothers’ COVID-related experiences, as well as maternal, family, and infant functioning, collected by the six HBCD sites via maternal reports and virtual visits and (b) mother-infant co-regulation of stress in home environments using remote multimodal sensing technology, the current study will provide unique opportunities for a nuanced and rich understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on infants born during this unprecedented time. Downstream effects of COVID-19 on infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes are likely to be transmitted, in part, through disruptions in the parent-infant relationship due to parents’ heightened stress and poorer mental health. This project will investigate such downstream effects using novel technology and machine learning methods that permit remote assessment of infants and parents in the home. Results from this project may aid in the development of “just-in-time” interventions for parents and infants at risk for relationships disturbance.",Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning,10239919,R34DA050256,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Arkansas', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Church', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Home Economics', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Job loss', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Mind', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'New York', 'North Carolina', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'depressive symptoms', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'falls', 'infancy', 'infection rate', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'maternal stress', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'patient home care', 'phase 1 study', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'remote sensing', 'resilience', 'sensor technology', 'social culture', 'stressor', 'virtual', 'virtual visit', 'vocalization']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R34,2021,234822
"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes  relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining  discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards  minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth  outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator  of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and  measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of  the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes.  Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data  for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal  trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on  birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health  prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically  evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among  young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds  on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1)  developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and  birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful  independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health  disparities. Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity.

"Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American ABSTRACT  Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity. Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.  We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin” and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.  The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health problems. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study will provide new information about how social stressors contribute to obesity among Mexican and Filipino American women. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that stressors lead to eating behaviors and dietary changes and that alter the brain-gut-microbiome axis. A better understanding of the role of how stress “gets under the skin” to contribute to alterations in the brain and gut microbial metabolites in obesity, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies tailored to treat altered ingestive behaviors and obesity.",Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American,10129475,R01MD015904,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Aromatic Amino Acids', 'Asians', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calories', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Fibrinogen', 'Filipino American', 'Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratio', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Neurologic', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Social Discrimination', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tryptophan', 'Woman', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'craving', 'dietary', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'food consumption', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'immune activation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'social culture', 'social stressor', 'stool sample', 'stressor', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning', 'waist circumference']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,779086
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,10150848,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,653664
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,10133145,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,191000
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,10120523,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'age group', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'movie', 'neglect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive mood', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social neuroscience', 'young adult']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,584996
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence. The proposed methods are firmly grounded in modern semiparametric theory which will be used to obtain more robust and efficient inferences about causal effects in a broad range of public health applications including in Epidemiology of Aging, Environmental Health Epidemiology and HIV/AIDS Prevention.",Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences,10159821,R01AG065276,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Africa', 'Aging', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Botswana', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetic', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Randomized', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical method', 'c new', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'intervention effect', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment as prevention', 'treatment effect', 'uptake', 'user friendly software']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,468961
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9981015,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'home test', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2021,118352
"Estimating Mediation Effects in Prevention Studies The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply  methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome  variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted  by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal  agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase  understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from  mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation  analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed  five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation  analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include  analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses  for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop  approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates  important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and  outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to  uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new  approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in  effectiveness from other individuals. For each study, we will investigate unique issues with mediation analysis of prevention data including methods for small N and also massive data collection (big data), the RcErLitEicVaANl rCoEle(Soeef imnsetruacstiounrse):ment for mediating mechanisms, and the application of the growing literature on  causal methods and Bayesian methods.

"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Abstract  Individual differences in brain structure, including cortical morphology and the white matter connectome are associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. The first year of life is a period of rapid and dynamic structural and functional brain development and new data from our cohort suggests that a large portion of individual differences in brain structure in 10 and 12 year olds is already present in the first year or two of life. Early adolescence and puberty is the second major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we propose to follow these children at 12, 14 and 16 years of age. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be performed. Cognitive and behavioral development will be assessed, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. We will determine how adolescent brain development contributes to individual differences in relation to early childhood development and whether the white matter connectome is a useful early imaging biomarker. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, and ultimately inform early intervention strategies that prevent or mitigate risk and illness severity. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding childhood brain development and its relationship to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence, and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative For years it has been hypothesized that psychiatric disorders are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development, though there is little direct evidence to support that hypothesis. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a longitudinal study that has followed children with imaging and developmental assessments from birth to age 10 years. We will study brain structure and function in these children at 12, 14, and 16 years with MRI to see if we can identify childhood predictors of behavior in adolescence that is considered at risk for psychiatric illness, which will ultimately help target periods of childhood development for early intervention.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10206731,R01MH123747,"['10 year old', '12 year old', '16 year old', '4 year old', '8 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Puberty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'adolescent brain development', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain abnormalities', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'executive function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'postnatal period', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'sex', 'social', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,763760
"Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S. NEW EVIDENCE ON CONCEPTION AND PREGNANCY LOSS IN THE U.S. ABSTRACT Conception failure and pregnancy loss impede the pathway to parenthood for millions of US couples each year. Despite being modifiable and common—pregnancy loss occurs fifty times as often as infant mortality— miscarriage is among the least well-studied aspects of population health or population dynamics. We know little about what causes these losses, the generalizability of estimates generated from the study of small recruited samples, including how the risk of miscarriage differs across time, place, or subpopulation.  These enormous gaps are driven by how difficult it is to study the pathway to live birth in humans, requiring a sufficiently large and diverse “preconception cohort.” To date small, nonrepresentative cohorts contribute most of what we know about early pregnancy. But limited sample size, variation, and coverage preclude the study of social and ecological factors—poverty, partner health, environmental exposures—that are now widely understood to shape mortality at later ages: e.g., stillbirth, infant, and child mortality. Such omissions are consequential. Conception failures and pregnancy loss have significant emotional and economic costs. Though pregnancy failures are likely distributed unevenly across populations, the size of this disparate burden is unknown. We do not have evidence about the potential impact of policies on the prevention of these outcomes.  Our research combines the tools of data science and social science to scale the preconception design to a large, diverse cohort in the US. Period and pregnancy “tracking” on digital devices is now common among reproductive-age women. We use data on 4 million women’s day-to-day recording of menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy, as well as reported social and economic characteristics. The data allow us to measure both reported and detected conception and pregnancy loss. We combine the data with georeferenced information about the physical, social, economic, and policy environments in which women and their partners live. The sample is diverse: users come from over 99% of U.S. counties; over 1 million users are on Medicaid. We use these extraordinary data to provide the first estimates of large-scale population variability in the pathway to live birth and to document factors that affect this pathway. Aim 1 develops new estimates of conception and pregnancy loss, including disparities associated with education, income, racial identification, and neighborhood poverty. Aim 2 estimates the contribution of male partner characteristics to conception and pregnancy loss, drawing on detailed data reported about partners. Aim 3 uses quasi-experimental designs to provide the first estimates of understudied exposures from multiple environmental, social, economic domains on conception and pregnancy loss. The research sheds new light on a pervasive and massively understudied public health concern, with direct implications for the improvement of early pregnancy outcomes. In so doing, the research also generates estimates that are much-needed inputs to support advancement in multiple, connected fields of study in the social, health, and biomedical sciences. NARRATIVE Conception failure and miscarriage affect millions of U.S. couples each year. This research uses new georeferenced data on pre-pregnancy and early pregnancy for 4 million U.S. women to provide the first evidence on individual, family, ecological, and policy factors that reduce the risk of early pregnancy failure.",Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S.,10143272,R01HD102207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Child Mortality', 'Clinic', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Consequentialism', 'County', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Devices', 'Economic Conditions', 'Economic Policy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fertility Study', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Maternal Health', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Menstrual cycle', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Ovulation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Sizes', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Conditions', 'Social Sciences', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Stratification', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data tools', 'design', 'digital', 'early pregnancy', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'field study', 'health disparity', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'population health', 'prediction algorithm', 'pregnancy failure', 'pregnant', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'social', 'social factors', 'spatiotemporal', 'stillbirth', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'tribal lands', 'trying to conceive']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,292268
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY – Parent U01  Emerging adulthood (ages 18-29 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance; therefore, to ad- dress this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, re- active processes are difficult to measure because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect inten- sive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. Data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within- days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learn- ing to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and meth- ods will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Network’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE - Parent U01 Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life.

"MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan PROJECT SUMMARY Macronutrients serve a multitude of roles beyond provision of energy, with numerous nutrients and/or their downstream metabolites acting as signaling molecules to coordinate cellular metabolism and function. Indeed, numerous nutrient sensing pathways (e.g. mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins) have evolved allowing us to respond to specific nutrients/metabolites, which in turn impacts healthspan. Sirtuins are largely thought to be driven by redox, whereby high levels of NAD, a cofactor in the sirtuin reaction and indicator of low energy charge, drives sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation of target proteins. SIRT1, the most-studied sirtuin, is a key nutrient sensing node that regulates a plethora of cellular functions to promote lifespan extension and healthy aging. As a result, there is immense interest in the use of SIRT1 activating compounds (STACs) to prevent or treat a wide range of aging-related disease. The links between dietary macronutrients, nutrient sensing and healthspan have historically focused upon caloric or protein restriction with limited attention given to dietary lipids. However, a small and growing body of literature has linked monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to improved healthspan. In addition to positive effects on lifespan and healthy aging in model organisms, dietary MUFAs have been linked to wide-ranging health benefits in epidemiological studies and, since they are a primary constituent of olive oil, thought to contribute to the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Despite these studies, little is known about the biological underpinnings through which MUFAs elicit their beneficial health effects. We have previously shown that lipid droplet catabolism (i.e. lipolysis) increases SIRT1 and downstream PGC-1a/PPAR- a signaling as a means to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function during times of nutrient deprivation. Our preliminary data show for the first time that MUFAs released specifically from lipolysis are trafficked to the nucleus where they allosterically activate SIRT1 towards select acetylated peptide substrates. This discovery makes MUFAs the first-known endogenous allosteric activators of SIRT1. Moreover, we show that MUFAs activate SIRT1 through a similar mechanism to resveratrol suggesting that MUFA signaling may modulate the response to exogenous SIRT1 activators. Based on these preliminary data, the objective of this application is to further characterize the role of MUFAs as endogenous SIRT1 activators. We hypothesize that MUFAs selectively activate SIRT1 to modulate the response to numerous dietary interventions known to impact healthspan. To test our objective, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To define how MUFAs modulate SIRT1 substrate selectivity. Aim 2: To characterize the SIRT1-dependent effects of MUFAs/olive oil on healthspan. Aim 3: To determine the contribution of MUFAs in mediating the response to STACs or caloric restriction. Upon completion of the proposes studies, we will have further expanded our understanding of SIRT1 biology allowing for refined approaches to activate SIRT1 to promote healthy aging. NARRATIVE The proposed studies will advance our understanding into the underlying biology linking dietary factors to healthspan. The data gleaned from these studies will help refine therapeutic or nutritional avenues to modulate lifespan and aging-related diseases resulting in a direct, positive impact on human health.",MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan,10263268,R01AG069768,"['Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Catabolism', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deacetylation', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fasting', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipolysis', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monounsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Mus', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oils', 'Olive oil preparation', 'Olives - dietary', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'PPAR alpha', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resveratrol', 'Role', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sirtuins', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cofactor', 'deacylation', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary', 'epidemiology study', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'middle age', 'mutant mouse model', 'novel', 'nutrient deprivation', 'polyphenol', 'prevent', 'red wine', 'response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,317579
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease.

"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,10129768,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,377498
"Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues This K99/R00 Award is designed to generate scholarship and interventions to guide genomics companies towards more just practices. It does so through a five-year training and research project, which investigates perspectives from members of the genomics industry, and leverages them to inform normative analyses and identify feasible paths towards concrete change. The project addresses issues of price, access and industrial control, with a focus on the ethics of profit and social responsibility. Through the proposed training program, the project prepares the candidate as an independent scholar whose research program links empirical and normative research with practical interventions to positively influence ethics and justice in private sector genomics. The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) investigates and leverages perspectives from members of the health-related private sector genomics industry, to develop guidance for improving approaches to social and ethical issues in the industry. It does so through in-depth qualitative analysis (interviews, cases studies, comparative analysis), scholarly normative analysis (drawing on theories from bioethics and business ethics), and a Delphi process of iterative questionnaires with industry stakeholders, aimed at strategizing concrete change regarding social obligations of the industry. The research and training program is designed to contribute to a more just distribution of the benefits of genomic technologies.",Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues,10307826,R00HG010499,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Biotechnology', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'California', 'Case Study', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Corporate Ethics', 'DNA', 'Decision Making', 'Delphi Study', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'India', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Justice', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Price', 'Privacy', 'Private Enterprises', 'Private Sector', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Social Justice', 'Social Obligations', 'Social Responsibility', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'comparative', 'curative treatments', 'design', 'drug development', 'ethical legal social implication', 'experience', 'gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'improved', 'individual response', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'nebula', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'population health', 'programs', 'research and development', 'social', 'theories', 'training project']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2021,249000
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,10089147,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,664089
"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cartoons', 'Chest', 'Clinical Research', 'Conscious', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Food Patterns', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population Research', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Reading', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Social Desirability', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'contextual factors', 'cooking', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized intervention', 'preservation', 'privacy preservation', 'sensor', 'tv watching', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'weight loss intervention', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and

larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and

"Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive, temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short- term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement, sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1 models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention. Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a leader in the field of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The goal of the present study is to develop personalized risk models of adolescent suicidal ideation based on passive and objective data sources (using wearables and smartphone sensors indexing social engagement, sleep, and physical activity).

"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games.

Existing vaccine candidates elicit antibodies against the target antigen but the associations between antibody functional activity and level and duration of protection are unknown. Additionally novel blood-stage antigens that could be used in future vaccines aimed at preventing symptomatic malaria have emerged (some are polymorphic), that need to be further investigated. Preferred antigens should elicit antibody functional activity that is: i) boosted with natural infection; ii) long-lasting; iii) correlated with protection; iv) not highly strain-specific, i.e., effective against a diversity of isolates. Our study aims to clarify these unknowns focusing on 12 understudied blood-stage antigens (and the alleles of those polymorphic antigens) to inform selection of antigens that could be potential vaccine candidates.  Prior studies of naturally-acquired antibody immunity have largely quantified antibody magnitude to specific proteins and have typically been limited to quantifying immune responses infrequently or at a single time-point. Because the immune profiles of individuals are dynamic and a function of exposure to infection that cannot be synchronized at the beginning of a study, these largely cross-sectional measurements obscure outcomes of interest. Furthermore, prior studies predominantly measured only magnitude of IgG responses; few have assessed the range and breath of functional activities of antibodies, and the impact of antigen polymorphisms on functional antibody activities.  The expertise of our study team, combined with access to samples collected during a longitudinal study with intensive follow-up and a comprehensive study approach, provides an opportunity to address these questions and elucidate the importance of these antigens in acquired immunity to malaria. Our study will be based on a cohort of children and adults who were seen monthly over two years in which subjects had repeated clinical and/or sub clinical malaria infections. Studying this cohort will enable us to gain new insights into the durability and boosting over time of functional antibody activity against blood-stage antigens upon natural exposure to malaria. We will also evaluate the cross-reactivity or strain-specificity of functional antibodies against alternative alleles of polymorphic antigens. Finally, we will evaluate antigens (and alleles) against which functional antibody activity is correlated with protection from symptomatic malaria and high density parasitemia, and we will seek signatures of functional responses that can accurately discriminate protected and unprotected subjects. These correlates of protection will provide endpoints for evaluating future vaccines. This may have implications for strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Development of an effective vaccine to combat malaria is hampered by knowledge gaps in malaria immunity. The general objective of our study is to inform selection of antigens for evaluation as potential vaccine candidates and establish approaches and principals that can be applied in future larger studies. We will use data from parasite genetics, new analytical approaches, and antibody functional activity targeting novel antigens that have promise as future vaccine candidates.",Longitudinal Antibody Profiles Correlated with Protection from Malaria in Malawi,10128971,R21AI151459,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Africa', 'African', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antibody-mediated protection', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Beds', 'Blood', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health care facility', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Malawi', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Time', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'acquired immunity', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'international center', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2021,276326
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10173577,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'data hub', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,3008531
"Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children PROJECT SUMMARY The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant pandemic of COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed global health systems and led to over 200,000 American deaths to date. While initial reports suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection in children was generally benign, a novel post-inflammatory syndrome known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has now been described. MIS-C in children is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and end-organ involvement, and the majority of patients are IgG seropositive for SARS- CoV-2. Because the clinical features of MIS-C overlap with other infections and inflammatory disorders, new strategies for diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children are urgently needed. Our immediate objective (during the R61 phase) is to determine the reproducible changes in breath, urine, and salivary volatile composition in chil- dren diagnosed with MIS-C. We will integrate these discovery studies with clinical and immunological profiling to develop (during R61 phase) and validate (during R33 phase) a novel and much-needed MIS-C diagnostic, which is expected to have a major impact on care of febrile children. Our long-term goal to develop a diagnostic strategy to distinguish children with MIS-C from children with other causes of fever. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate our expertise and feasibility of this strategy, our objectives will be met through three specific aims: 1) Characterize breath biomarkers in children with MIS-C (R61); 2) Relate breath VOC changes to virolog- ical, disease severity, and immunological features of MIS-C (R61); and 3) Validate our novel MIS-C diagnostic for clinical use (R33). The proposed research is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed MIS-C rapid diagnostic tool. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because there is no current validated diagnostic tool for the post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory disorder in children, MIS-C. Our proposal will develop a new strategy to diagnose this disorder, which will directly improve care of children with fever and help support future clinical studies.",Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children,10272856,R61HD105594,"['2019-nCoV', 'Academy', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'American', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Canis familiaris', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Virology', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical epidemiology', 'coronavirus disease', 'global health', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'seropositive', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'translational study', 'validation studies', 'virology', 'volatile organic compound']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R61,2021,879259
"Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically- enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms (N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia, modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned. The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Mental disorders are often early-onset chronic diseases, with brain and behavioral risk markers of common internalizing/externalizing problems evident in infancy. To accelerate translation, we will use multi-method imaging, behavioral and data science innovations to generate an infant mental health risk calculator for pragmatic public health use, derived from a clinically enriched “Mental Health Earlier-Synthetic Cohort” of 1,020 infants using established study samples (characterized from birth-54 months). Clinical prediction algorithms will deliver broadly useful tools for earlier prediction and prevention of mental disorder and parameters to inform when imaging methods will be most informative in large-scale neurodevelopmental studies.","Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach",10162666,R01MH121877,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Height', 'Infant', 'Interview', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Studies', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'emotion dysregulation', 'epidemiologic data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mental disorder prevention', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary care setting', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk prediction', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,1468303
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome PROJECT SUMMARY Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are the most common pregnancy complication and are associated with an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is also the leading cause of death for women in the US. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP. However, several limitations exist, including 1) the ignorance of residential mobility during pregnancy in exposure assessments, 2) the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, and 3) the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome). While HDP have been linked to long-term CVD risk after pregnancy, limited data are available on early maternal CVD risk (within the first five years after delivery) complicated by HDP. More importantly, no study has focused on the impact of environmental exposures during and after pregnancy on maternal CVD risk after pregnancy. In addition, risk assessment models of HDP predominantly rely on biomarkers that are not ubiquitously tested among all pregnant women, and no predictive model has been developed to identify women at higher CVD risk after pregnancy. This study builds on our prior work in the external exposome and leverages our access to the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium to address multiple challenges in the field by: 1) determining the association between pregnancy external exposome and risk of HDP, considering the subtype, onset, and severity of HDP and accounting for pregnancy residential mobility in exposure measurements; 2) assessing early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy associated with HDP and the external exposome, and 3) developing predictive models of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy. This research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program consisting of coursework, guided experiential and clinical learning, seminars, and mentorship by an established team of experts. The training program is designed to further my strengths and to develop new research skills while contributing to our scientific understanding of environmental impacts on cardiovascular health among pregnant and postpartum women. The training proposal details a five-year plan of formal and informal instruction in cardiovascular health, omics and exposome research, biomedical informatics and data science, and professional skills. My short-term career goals include completing coursework in all training areas, disseminating study findings through publications and presentations, engaging in career development activities, and applying for independent R01 funding in the third year of the award. My long-term career goal is to become an independent, collaborative, and productive epidemiologist and health data scientist leading research programs in cardiovascular health, with a focus on its intersection with perinatal and environmental epidemiology using big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a major cause of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) after pregnancy. However, multiple challenges and knowledge gaps exist in previous studies such as the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome), and limited understandings on how environmental exposures during pregnancy may impact subsequent maternal CVD risk after delivery. Leveraging the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from OneFlorida, this study builds on our prior work in the external exposome, aiming to examine the associations between the external exposome and risk of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy as well as to develop predictive models of HDP and maternal CVD after pregnancy to guide precision preventions.",Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome,10214088,K01HL153797,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Eclampsia', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Play', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residential Mobility', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'career', 'career development', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital repositories', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health data', 'hypertensive factor', 'individualized prevention', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'informal learning', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,167207
"Improving precision in modeling childhood executive function trajectories using psychometrics Project Summary: Executive functions are high-level supervisory cognitive skills vital for a child’s social and academic success. Their core components include working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of executive functions in children can be adversely affected by many early life risk factors, such as lead exposure and low socioeconomic status. However, there are two difficulties to precisely measuring and modeling executive functions, which hamper our understanding of how risk factors can predict shifts in executive functioning: 1) It is common to use a single child performance task to tap into an executive function component. While this can yield important information, it can also lead to bias, because executive functions can be difficult to measure precisely, since they are interdependent and also rely on non-executive function skills. 2) It can be challenging to model the longitudinal development of executive functions because the set of tasks used to assess executive functions can change as a child grows. Some tasks may be specific to a particular age range and not appropriate for other ages. To address the first difficulty, we will improve the precision of measuring an executive function component by using well-established latent variable approaches which integrate output from multiple tasks. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that this approach can yield improved interpretability of a risk factor’s impact on an executive function component, compared to separate analyses of each task. To address the second difficulty, we propose to use advanced psychometric and item response theory methods to create a longitudinal scale of executive functioning with optimized precision and construct validity that span all the ages of interest. This will allow us to identify how risk factors can predict changes in executive function over time (e.g. developmental trajectory). This proposal leverages data from two large, NIH-funded prospective birth cohorts with extensive longitudinal data and repeated assessments of many executive function tasks, and detailed measures of risk factors (e.g. lead exposure, low socioeconomic status). Open-source, user-friendly software for the developed approaches will be developed, including a web application for non-statistical users. I (Dr. Shelley Liu) am a biostatistician and an Assistant Professor in Population Health Science and Policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). ISMMS provides an excellent environment for this K25; all mentors and advisory committee members are based at ISMMS. My training will involve 1) formal graduate level coursework on executive function development, child neuropsychology, item response theory and psychometric scaling; 2) tutorials in neurodevelopment and psychometrics with my mentoring team; and 3) clinical rotations to observe neurobehavioral assessments. This training will complement my existing expertise in biostatistics. I aim to become an independent, R01-funded researcher studying child neurodevelopment and associated risk factors.

"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher.

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,10067382,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,680832
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,10143063,R37MH066078,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Educational Intervention', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Ensure', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic twins', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'connectome', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mental function', 'mindfulness', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'program dissemination', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,646865
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain CircuitsPD Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain CircuitsPD,10252236,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,26105
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",10144963,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,1020000
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10229591,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1364066
"“Overlapping and Discrete Pathways Through Which Prenatal Isolation and Uncertainty Stress Impact Maternal Mental Health and Child Neurodevelopment PROJECT SUMMARY The prenatal period is regarded as one of the most sensitive phases in human development. Events that occur during gestation can alter the course of development with lasting impact. Presently, the COVID-19 pandemic is exerting wide-spread impact on the lives of expectant mothers around the world. Particularly salient pandemic- related stressors that are being experienced by pregnant women are social isolation and uncertainty stress. There is ample physiological and behavioral literature showing that social isolation and uncertainty stress affect typical human and animal psychobiological functioning, but there is an absence of knowledge about how these conditions might impact the physical and psychological health of a pregnant woman, and what the consequences of those changes might be for her developing child. The central objective of this proposal is to build foundational knowledge about the effects of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal psychobiology and infant neurobehavior. We will explore several candidate physiological systems in the mother to elucidate mechanisms that underlie associations between maternal stressors and child outcomes. To achieve these goals, we will recruit 200 women from a large New York City cohort established at the height of the pandemic into a prospective, longitudinal study that will include pre- and postnatal biospecimen collection and child neurobehavioral assessments at 6-, 12- and 24 months. Multi-modal neuroimaging strategies, including infant EEG and quantitative MRI, and innovative remote biophysical data collection strategies will be employed. The primary aims of this project are to (i) examine the impact of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal biology and postnatal mental health; (ii) evaluate the influence of maternal prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on infant neurobehavioral development; and (iii) examine the role of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on mother-infant bi-directional interactions. We will thus be able to meaningfully evaluate whether, and how, prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress modify maternal biology and affect, and the neurobehavioral consequences of those impacts on infants. Such work would constitute a substantial advance in our understanding of the longitudinal effects of prenatal psychosocial stress exposures, the underlying mechanistic pathways, and the origins of child neurobehavioral disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Isolation, insecurity and uncertainty can impact the psychiatric health of pregnant mothers, with substantial lasting morbidity for mother and child. The goal of this project is to lay critical foundations for understanding the biological consequences of social isolation and uncertainty stress, and the roles they play in both maternal and child outcomes.",“Overlapping and Discrete Pathways Through Which Prenatal Isolation and Uncertainty Stress Impact Maternal Mental Health and Child Neurodevelopment,10231690,R01MH126468,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Allopregnanolone', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disasters', 'Economics', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Endocrine', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Leptin', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Myelin', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social isolation', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'course development', 'experience', 'family support', 'follow-up', 'imaging approach', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'offspring', 'pandemic disease', 'physical conditioning', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'response', 'restraint', 'sensor technology', 'serial imaging', 'sound', 'stressor', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,871099
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric diseases and Anorexia Nervosa is two to three times more deadly than schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder. The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP) aims to provide a (a) scientific, (b) operational, and (c) educational infrastructure for innovative neuroscience-based research to use individual differences on several biological levels together with sophisticated statistical approaches to generate clinically meaningful predictions of risk and outcomes for mood, anxiety, and eating disorders. The Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) in Tulsa, OK, is ideally placed to provide this infrastructure because: (a) LIBR has recruited young investigators with an impressive track record of scientific productivity, (b) LIBR is situated adjacent to the Laureate Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital (LPCH), one of the Midwest's largest psychiatric facilities that provides LIBR with a pipeline for patient recruitment, and (c) LIBR closely collaborates with the University of Tulsa (TU) on computational statistics and University of Oklahoma, Tulsa (OU) on bioassay research. The Specific Aims of NeuroMAP are: (1) To provide a state of the art neuroimaging and laboratory infrastructure to conduct biological experiments with multi-level assessments using core facilities; (2) To provide a mentoring infrastructure to a group of young investigators to conduct studies that identify predictive biological markers and processes for patients with mood or anxiety disorders; (3) To create a career development infrastructure to accelerate the investigator's transition from young investigator to established investigator; (4) To build an operational infrastructure that provides the tools necessary to conduct the research projects, standardize assessments and provide a data repository for future pilot projects. NeuroMAP will consists of: (a) an Administrative Core (Paulus): to establish the infrastructure necessary to expand the research efforts of the young investigators; (b) Research Core (Bodurka, Teague, McKinney): to provide the technical expertise to utilize multi-level approaches (from cell markers to symptoms) to quantify individual differences and generate outcome predictions.

However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology).

"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system.

"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",10356481,R44DA046151,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'User Compliance', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'active method', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'randomized controlled study', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'sobriety', 'software development', 'stress management', 'stress reduction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,"CONTINUEYOU, LLC",R44,2021,739128
"The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long- term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care, would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and recommendations for future policy implementation. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies have been shown to disparately impact socially vulnerable and under-served minority groups in the US. This proposed study develops an innovative approach to analyzing the effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on American Indian populations living on tribal lands and in rural areas, by integrating big data and deep learning techniques with primary data collection.

"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,642893
"Leveraging deep learning and clinical notes for surveillance and prediction of intentional self-harm and suicide PROJECT SUMMARY: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. The identification of individuals at risk for suicide is an important step for a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention. Despite extensive research on risk factors for intentional self-harm and suicide, prospective prediction of suicide remains a difficult task with poor predictive power. Recent studies suggest that new machine learning methods applied to electronic health records (EHR) show promising results. However, more advanced computational approaches such as deep learning, have not been fully leveraged in this field, especially in the area of advanced methods for text classification of clinical notes. Our aims in this project, are to improve the phenotyping of suicidal behavior, and the prediction of future suicidal behavior and suicide deaths by integrating mortality data with EHR data and leveraging state-of-the-art natural language computational approaches. We will also investigate methods for explain ability and interpretability of the models to improve future adoption by clinicians. We will validate our models by examining reproducibility and generalizability across two health systems using similar data at both sites. Project Narrative Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. In this project, we plan to improve the identification of patients at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior, by linking mortality data with electronic health records data and using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence such as deep learning.

"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing longitudinal built environment exposure measures from street-view and satellite imagery using deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data from a) 500 participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) and b) over 34 years of geocoded residential addresses from three large nationwide cohorts of over 288,000 US adult women and men from the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts. Our work will enable us to measure time-varying exposure to the built environment with unprecedented precision in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, to better specify pathways to CVD incidence, and ultimately, to yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.",Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health,10192819,R01HL150119,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Global Positioning System', 'Green space', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Noise', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Planet Earth', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'experience', 'extreme temperature', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'insight', 'land use', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'novel', 'petabyte', 'spatiotemporal', 'urban area', 'urban planning', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2021,785476
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,10164858,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital healthcare', 'experience', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'remote monitoring', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,649383
"A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare Project Summary Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to non-communicable disease worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease. The current standards of care suffer from subjectivity, inconsistent delivery, and limited access with growing waitlists. New informatics solutions, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) that can port to more ubiquitous mobile health devices and that are not restricted for use in clinical settings, have great potential to complement or even replace aspects of the standards of care. We propose to develop a novel informatics solution for one of the most pressing mental health burdens, autism, which is up in incidence by more than 600% since 1990, among the fastest growing pediatric concerns today, and highly representative of many other neuropsychiatric conditions. We have invented a prototype mobile system called Guess What (guesswhat.stanford.edu) (GW) that turns the focus of the camera on the child through a fluid social engagement with his/her social partner that reinforces prosocial learning while simultaneously measuring the child’s developmental learning progress. At its simplest level, the GW app challenges the child to imitate social and emotion-centric prompts shown on the screen of a smartphone held just above the eyes of the individual with whom the child is playing. But more, as a home-based repeat-use system, GW uses computer vision algorithms and emotion classifiers integrated into gameplay to detect emotion in the child’s face via the phone’s front camera, automatically finding agreement with the displayed prompt, while capturing features such as gaze, eye contact, and joint attention. Preliminary work with more than 20 autistic children resulted in positive user feedback, evidence of high engagement for both the parents and children, and importantly, evidence of clinically meaningful gains in socialization. A single session produces 90 seconds of enriched social video and sensor data, opening up an exciting opportunity for the game play itself to passively generate labeled computer vision libraries that enable the development of better models with higher diagnostic precision going forward. Our proposed project will show that GW can (a.) serve as a mobile therapy that can be used repeatedly by families to target core deficits of autism while inherently tracking progress during use, and, (b.) serve as a distributed system to crowdsource the acquisition of new labeled image libraries for AI models that can automatically classify diagnostic features relevant to autism and extend to other sectors of mental health (and even beyond). Project Narrative Mental health, which accounts for a significant percentage of the global health burden, can be effectively managed through mobile and digital tools, yet suffers from limited access, inconsistent treatments, and qualitative approaches that do not scale. Taking aim at an increasingly pervasive and canonical mental health problem, autism, we plan to build a game-based solution that can treat (addressing issues social interaction, eye contact, and social-emotional awareness, among other things) while tracking progress, and that can automatically generate computer vision libraries for deep learning models that permit enhanced diagnostic feature extraction in the future.",A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare,10122795,R01LM013364,"['8 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Anger', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Distributed Systems', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Forehead', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'computer generated', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'feasibility testing', 'feature extraction', 'gaze', 'global health', 'image archival system', 'innovation', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'mHealth', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized health care', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sensor', 'social', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'social reciprocity', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,667434
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,10150095,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,660945
"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,173784
"Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention ABSTRACT. Decades of research to improve the prevention and early detection of suicide risk has largely resulted in the detection of who is most likely to consider suicide, but not when or if that is most likely to happen. Most detection methods presume patients are in contact with the healthcare system, which only reaches a proportion of the at-risk population. Many people at high risk for suicide do not seek professional help because of lack of time, stigma, and fear regarding how they will be treated in the health care system. It is imperative that we develop methods that can identify proximal risk for suicide that does not depend on system- level contact. Web-based search tools are ubiquitous, with 46% of the global population using the internet for information searches and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that this online search-engine behavior may prove to be an effective, private, and immediate method of proximal risk detection of suicide for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. We will recruit 1,000 people with mental illness with varying risk for suicide. Participants will provide us access to Google Take-Out (GTO) data, which includes search-engine history and behavior including YouTube. Participants will include those who have report a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250). All will participate using gold-standard suicide behavior research instruments. Using a case-crossover design, we will evaluate the intermittent exposures (search based proximal risk factors) with an immediate and transient effect on risk and an abrupt outcome (suicide attempt). The case-crossover design is a well-tested and proven approach especially in cases where transient events can trigger acute events such as cardiovascular events, injuries, and death due to environmental exposures and has been studied with interview data to determine warning signs for suicide attempts. Further for predicting suicidal attempt/s, we will use robust ensemble-based machine learning methods such as random forest, gradient boosting to evaluate the predictive nature of qualitative and quantitative features. The study will conclude in a collaborative dissemination planning process with our community partners. Thus, this retrospective and prospective study that aligns GTO data with carefully assessed suicidal thoughts and behaviors has the potential to identify warning signs in search and YouTube data that predict when suicidal risk and lay the groundwork for innovative pathways to suicide prevention. Narrative. Online search-engine behavior (Google and YouTube) may be an effective, private, and immediate method of suicide risk detection for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. In this study, participants who made a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt but over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250) will complete gold- standard research assessments of suicidal thoughts and behavior and provide Google Take-Out Search and YouTube data. Using a case-crossover design, we will identify and evaluate proximal risk factors in search- engine behavior; that is, patterns that change at the time of suicidal behavior or increases in suicidal ideation and lay the groundwork for ethical, feasible, and acceptable online interventions that can be deployed immediately when suicide risk is high.",Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention,10207109,R01MH123484,"['Acute', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Facebook', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'cohort', 'cost', 'detection method', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'information seeking behavior', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'online intervention', 'predictive tools', 'prevention service', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'screening', 'search engine', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,876668
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment.

"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",10164860,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,718829
"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry.

"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,10114245,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,174255
"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,10077375,R21MH121886,"['Behavioral', 'Bereavement', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Grief reaction', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'United Kingdom', 'Visit', 'base', 'end of life care', 'expressive writing', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'help-seeking behavior', 'informal support', 'loved ones', 'metropolitan', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide model', 'tool', 'web site', 'web-based tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2021,206083
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early preemptive interventions.",Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning,10108555,R21MH125346,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crude Extracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'early life stress', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'long short term memory network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maltreatment', 'open source', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'postnatal period', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prenatal', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public repository', 'recurrent neural network', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2021,179604
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics.

"The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Intervention for Improving Child Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Early childhood mental health problems constitute a significant public health concern with wide-ranging impacts on functioning both concurrently and later in life. Although childhood mental health is influenced by a variety of factors, the quality of relationships with caregivers plays a critical role. Critical, coercive, and conflictual parent- child interactions have been consistently linked with increased risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, whereas supportive and nurturing relationships have been shown to confer protective effects. Early intervention of maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories in at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent- child relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training/education, in-person therapy, home visiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility, generalizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore, limitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services render them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily accessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life—when and where support is needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional appointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in- time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday life. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to their successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables, our interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect psychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the current project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic response to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion, and intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build software to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine learning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child mental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models with the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental health problems in childhood are highly prevalent and impairing, placing an immense social and economic burden on society. Parent-child relationships in the early years of life play a critical role in promoting child mental health, with critical and coercive relationships increasing the risk of mental health problems across the lifespan.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics.

"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,10119327,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,641065
"Leveraging interactive SMS messaging to monitor and support maternal mental health in Kenya ABSTRACT Perinatal depression, defined as a depressive episode during pregnancy or in the first year postpartum, is the most common complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of peripartum women globally. An enormous gap exists in supporting women experiencing perinatal depression. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions such as interactive SMS text messaging with healthcare workers (HCWs) have been proposed as resource-efficient, accessible adjuncts to in-person care. Realizing the full public health potential of mHealth for mental health will require strategic use of automation and empiric definition of interventions that dynamically adapt to user needs. This K18 mentored career enhancement award aims to support Dr. Keshet Ronen, an epidemiologist with multidisciplinary training, to become an expert in analysis of mHealth communication and development of adaptive mHealth interventions. Building on Dr. Ronen’s established expertise in development and evaluation of mHealth interventions using SMS and social media, and supported by a team of experienced mentors, the following research and training aims are proposed. Training plan: Through didactic coursework, individual mentor meetings, seminars, and conferences, Dr. Ronen seeks to accomplish the following Career Enhancement Goals. (1) Gain proficiency and experience using natural language processing and machine learning methods to analyze mHealth communication. (2) Gain proficiency and experience in design of an adaptive mHealth intervention. (3) Deepen understanding of mHealth intervention design for mental health. (4) Enhance skills in international study implementation and clinical trial design. The proposed training plan will augment Dr. Ronen’s prior training and experience and allow her to complete the proposed Research plan: Mobile WACh is a unique interactive SMS messaging platform that has been shown to improve maternal-child health and whose impact on perinatal depression is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in Kenya, Mobile WACh Neo. We propose to leverage a dataset of >100,000 SMS messages with >3000 peripartum women in previous and ongoing Mobile WACh studies to (1) develop a predictive model that can detect client SMS indicating elevated depression symptoms, and (2) identify HCW message characteristics associated with improvements in depression symptoms. (3) Models from Aims 1-2 will be implemented in the Mobile WACh software to develop an adaptive version of Mobile WACh Neo that flags concerning messages and guides HCWs on SMS composition. A pilot study of Adaptive Mobile WACh Neo will be conducted, nested within the Mobile WACh Neo randomized controlled trial in Kenya (R01HD098105), to evaluate its acceptability and preliminary impact on time taken for HCWs to respond to client messages. Collectively, these activities will enable Dr. Ronen to become a leader in the study of adaptive mHealth interventions to support maternal mental health in resource-limited settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy, but it is undertreated due to lack of mental healthcare resources and barriers to in-person care. Short message service (SMS) text messaging is a promising tool to support mental health in the high-risk peripartum period.

"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram. This will be accomplished using an innovative methodology involving advanced machine learning, statistical, geospatial and network analysis.",Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution,10142413,R21DA050689,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communications Media', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vendor', 'Youth', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient advocacy group', 'peer influence', 'prescription drug abuse', 'response', 'service providers', 'social media', 'study population', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,197344
"Identification of Trauma-related Features in EHR Data for Patients with Psychosis and Mood Disorders Project Summary Psychotic and mood disorders represent a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. There is considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients. Developing clinically implementable machine learning (ML) tools to enable accurate patient stratification is critically important in order to augment effective personalized treatment plans. Among the factors contributing to heterogeneity, childhood trauma is an under-recognized source. The prevalence of childhood trauma is significant in adults with psychiatric disorders. Robust evidence shows that: i) individuals exposed to childhood abuse are 2-3 times more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder later in life, particularly psychosis; ii) childhood traumas impact critical windows of brain development and can trigger the onset of psychosis; and iii) among patients with psychotic and mood disorders, childhood trauma influences psychopathology, leading to more severe symptoms, poorer long-term outcomes (longer and higher rate of relapses or rehospitalization), associated with substance abuse, and are often treatment resistant and function poorly in society. Although evidence clearly indicates that childhood trauma contributes to psychiatric risk and poor treatment outcomes, large-scale computational approaches to stratify subpopulations, extract trauma features (e.g., frequency, type), and examine the links or the impact of trauma features on psychopathology and treatment outcome have yet to be developed. We propose to create gold standard annotations from Electronic health records (EHRs) and to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and ML methods to develop a standardized re-useable data model for automatically extracting trauma-related features, complex concepts, and symptom dimensions from EHRs. We will train and evaluate a semi-supervised NLP model, which is built as a joint sequence model that can both identify named entities as well as extract the relations between them. We will apply multiple strategies to validate the robustness of our model. Our proposed NLP model is essentially a “computational version of a chart review” tool, designed to mimic human chart review but performed automatically with the ability to scale. We will use this model to stratify psychosis subgroups (with or without childhood trauma history) and to correlate among the extracted features with important clinical outcome variables. Importantly, the annotation guidelines, corpus, and the data model developed by us will be valuable resources to researchers in the field. The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in psychiatric phenotyping and application of EHRs, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in ML to natural language data. The model architecture developed in this application will lay the groundwork for a future clinical trial application. Project Narrative There is considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients with psychotic and mood disorders. This project will use electronic health record databases and machine learning approaches to automatically stratify subpopulations, to examine the impact of childhood trauma on psychopathology, and to establish a gold standard annotation guideline and a standardized re-useable data model for use by the psychiatric community.

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,10063429,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'dietary', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obese person', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,165181
"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence. The objectives of this proposal are consistent with NICHD's high-priority research areas that aim to develop new knowledge about the identification, etiology, early intervention, and mechanisms of violence from childhood through early adulthood.",Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention,10096109,R01HD103630,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Legal Guardians', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Process Assessment', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'school violence', 'school violence prevention', 'screening', 'study population', 'youth violence']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,457950
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,10149408,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'feature extraction', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'multiple datasets', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,501430
"HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract We assess the feasibility of mobile technologies to study the psychophysiological underpinnings of affect in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). In this feasibility pilot study, we will evaluate participants’ adherence to the procedures of a longitudinal study, including: 1. wearing wearable sensors for the duration of the study, 2. completing research activities involving prompted and self-initiated self-reports on momentary experiences of stress and negative affect. We will also examine the validity and reliability of the physiological data captured with two wearable sensors from two different brands and that are placed in different body locations. It is important to assess the reliability of data from two devices simultaneously to examine issues that may hinder a study’s viability, like data noise, signal problems, or data loss, etc. Lastly, we will utilize this data to investigate the role of autonomic function as a valid physiological marker of stress and negative affect in OUD. This has relevant implications in the understanding and development of digital treatments, as stress and negative affect are major contributors of relapse. This pilot work will contribute to the aim 2 of the parent grant by using digital and computational health cores to advance research in mHealth, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, the work supported under this supplement will serve as a building block to successfully create and submit an F31 grant proposal, a research that will be carried out following the diversity supplement period. This supplement will support the intensive training and invaluable practical experience that will advance the career of the trainee, Veronica Ramirez. This is in alignment with aim 6 of the parent grant to “expand the pipeline for early investigators” and create programs that support “addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship”. Aligned with this, our research can ultimately help current efforts to address the opioid epidemic to ameliorate its detrimental effects on society. Project Narrative This proposal aims to address the complex problem of addiction and the opioid epidemic. This is important due to the cascade of negative impacts on society. Understanding the psychophysiological factors that interact with disrupted neurobiological systems resulting in increased negative affect could clarify drug addiction trajectories and apply this knowledge to the development of digital therapeutics in mHealth.",HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network,10354615,UG1DA049467,"['Abstinence', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Faculty', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysiology', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Veronica', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Writing', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'digital', 'digital mental health', 'digital treatment', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'implementation science', 'indexing', 'mHealth', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'new technology', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'parent grant', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'stress reactivity', 'substance misuse', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2021,70982
"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,10061648,R01MH121455,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family Study', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'structured data', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'trait']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,543736
"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,10074594,R34MH119411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Mental Health Centers', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personnel Turnover', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Management', 'Predictive Factor', 'Productivity', 'Professional Burnout', 'Psyche structure', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'complex data', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental health organization', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'rural area', 'theories', 'treatment services', 'urban area']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2021,230630
"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,10162664,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2021,428695
"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools.

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Military sexual trauma (MST) is a serious and pervasive problem among military populations, affecting approximately 16% of military personnel and veterans [1]. Substance use disproportionately affects individuals with a history of MST. Individuals with (vs. without) a history of MST are twice as likely to misuse substances [2-4]. Substance use among military samples has been linked to higher rates of negative consequences across several domains (e.g., health, occupational, legal [5, 6]), including death (e.g., overdose [7], traffic accidents [8], suicide [7, 8]). Further, while understudied among individuals with a history of MST in particular, negative substance use outcomes have been shown to be more severe among trauma-exposed populations, including more severe clinical presentations and poorer treatment prognosis [9, 10]. These findings emphasize the importance of clarifying the association between MST and substance use among military populations. Despite the clinical relevance and public health significance of substance use among military populations, research in this area has relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional designs. Moreover, the vast majority of studies in this area have utilized traditional statistical methods, which are limited in scope and capabilities. These limitations have important clinical implications, as they restrict our ability to specify the exact nature and directionality of the relationship between MST and substance use, thereby affecting how findings are translated into prevention and intervention efforts. The proposed research aims to fill these critical gaps by utilizing the Army STARRS pre/post-deployment study, a large, prospective military dataset to: (1) explicate the directional relation between MST and substance use using a longitudinal dataset, and (2) employ machine learning methods to develop an algorithm to optimize detection of substance use in military personnel with a history of MST. These findings will assist in elucidating the etiology of substance use among this high-risk group, as well as provide a prediction model for clinical use to better target at-risk individuals in this population. This research project will take place within the Department of Psychology at the University of Rhode Island; an institution with a strong history and commitment to health behavior research and methodology. The applicant will have access to sponsors and consultants with expertise in MST, substance use, advanced methodology, and statistical analysis that will facilitate her career objectives to develop increased knowledge and proficiency in (a) sexual trauma (e.g., MST) and substance use in military veterans; (b) grant/manuscript development; (c) statistical and methodological capabilities (i.e., machine learning); and (d) big data. The proposed project uses a timely and innovative approach to advance science on the relation between MST and substance use in military personnel. Addressing substance use in this population is necessary to improve the health of our nation's veterans, and aligns with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Project Narrative Military sexual trauma (MST) is highly prevalent among military personnel and is associated with disproportionate rates of substance use. By explicating the directional relation between MST and substance use, and utilizing machine learning to develop high-quality prediction models for clinical use, the proposed study will inform prevention and intervention efforts for this high-risk group. Findings will be used to improve clinical outcomes among military personnel with exposure to MST, and reduce the onset and maintenance of problematic substance use and associated negative consequences.",Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach,10140573,F31DA051167,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Overdose', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Medication', 'Service provision', 'Sexual Harassment', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Traffic accidents', 'Translating', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'military service', 'military veteran', 'outcome forecast', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'sexual assault', 'sexual trauma', 'skills', 'social', 'stem', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'trauma exposure']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,F31,2021,41003
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,10300427,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'efficacious treatment', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2021,33247
"Enhancing Engagement with Digital Mental Health Care Enhancing Engagement with Digital Mental Health Care Abstract Digital mental health (DMH) is the use of technology to improve population well-being through rapid disease detection, outcome measurement, and care1. Although several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that digital mental health tools are highly effective2-6, most consumers do not sustain their use of these tools7-9. The field currently lacks an understanding of DMH tool engagement, how engagement is associated with well-being, and what practices are effective at sustaining engagement. In this partnership between Mental Health America (MHA), Talkspace (TS) and the University of Washington (UW), we propose a naturalistic and experimental, theory-driven program10,11 of research, with the aim of understanding 1) how consumer engagement in self-help and clinician assisted DMH varies and what engagement patterns exist, 2) the association between patterns of engagement and important consumer outcomes, and 3) the effectiveness of personalized strategies for optimal engagement with DMH treatment. This study will prospectively follow a large, naturalistic sample of MHA and TS consumers, and will apply machine learning, user-centered design strategies, and micro-randomized and sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMART) trials to address these aims. As is usual practice for both platforms, consumers will complete online mental health screening and assessment, and we will be able to classify participants by disease status and symptom severity. The sample we will be working with will not be limited by diagnosis or co-morbidities. Participants will be 10 years old and older and enter the MHA and TS platforms prospectively over 4 years. In order to test the first aim, we will identify a minimum of 100,000 consumers who have accessed MHA and TS platforms in the past. Participant data will be analyzed statistically to reveal differences in engagement and dropout across groups based on demographics, symptoms and platform activity. For aim 2, we will use supervised machine learning techniques to identify subtypes based on consumer demographics, engagement patterns with DMH, reasons for disengagement, success of existing MHA and TS engagement strategies, and satisfaction with the DMH tools, that are predictive of future engagement patterns. Finally, based on the outcomes from aim 2, in aim 3 we will conduct focus groups applying user-centered design strategies to identify and co-build potentially effective engagement strategies for particular client subtypes. We will then conduct a series of micro-randomized and SMART trials to determine which theory-driven engagement strategies, co-designed with users, have the greatest fit with subtypes developed under aim 2. We will test the effectiveness of these strategies to 1) prevent disengagement from those who are more likely to have poor outcomes after disengagement, 2) improve movement from motivation to volition and, 3) enhance optimal dose of DMH engagement and consequently improve mental health outcomes. These data will be analyzed using longitudinal mixed effects models with effect coding to estimate the effectiveness of each strategy on client engagement behavior and mental health outcomes. Project Narrative: This proposal is a partnership between Mental Health America (MHA), a nonprofit mental health advocacy and resource organization, Talkspace (TS), a for-profit, online digital psychotherapy organization, and the University of Washington’s Schools of Medicine and Computer Science Engineering (UW). The purpose of this partnership is to create a digital mental health research platform leveraging MHA and TS’s marketing platforms and consumer base to describe the characteristics of optimal engagement with digital mental health treatment, and to identify effective, personalized methods to enhance motivation to engage in digital mental health treatment in order to improve mental health outcomes. These aims will be met by identifying and following at least 100,000 MHA and TS consumers over the next 4 years, apply machine learning approaches to characterizing client engagement subtypes, and apply micro-randomized trials to study the effectiveness of motivational enhancement strategies and response to digital mental health treatment.",Enhancing Engagement with Digital Mental Health Care,10114798,R01MH125179,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Advocacy', 'Age', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Income', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Series', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Volition', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'coping', 'demographics', 'design', 'digital', 'digital mental health', 'effectiveness study', 'effectiveness testing', 'expectation', 'falls', 'health goals', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'self help', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'tool', 'trial design', 'user centered design', 'web page']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,872555
"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success because of a number of important advantages over the designs used in previous studies.",Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors,10075983,R01MH121478,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Decision Making', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Employment', 'Equilibrium', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Link', 'Marital Status', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Probability', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical practice', 'collaborative care', 'common treatment', 'comparative treatment', 'completed suicide', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'reducing suicide', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicide rate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment planning', 'treatment trial', 'unethical', 'virtual']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,771357
"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Accelerometer', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Collection', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotions', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impulsivity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'analytical method', 'burnout', 'career development', 'data streams', 'design', 'diaries', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk drinking', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'meter', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research study', 'sensor', 'stressor', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338
"Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Although the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for significant health and economic costs throughout the world, relatively little is known about its effect on children. The first pediatric case of SARS- CoV-2 in the United States was reported on March 2, 2020, and within just three months, over 64,000 cases were confirmed. Even though children, as a group, have been relatively spared from the effects of the virus, there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that some may become critically ill. Since a number of children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, more research on determinants of disease and long-term outcomes of those affected is critical. Dr. Oliveira is a pediatric infectious disease clinician whose long-term goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist, who integrates the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and biomedical informatics to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The work described in this proposal builds on the scientific themes he developed throughout his prior training and aims to mechanistically understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in children by integrating three different scientific tools: natural language processing, machine learning, and clinical epidemiology. The first consideration for this K23 award period will be to use novel computational tools to build automated surveillance and data-extraction system that can facilitate the identification and tracking of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children (Aim 1). Using this surveillance system, Dr. Oliveira will create a comprehensive registry and conduct a rigorous, model-based investigation to derive a state-of-the-art prediction model of clinical deterioration in children with SARS-CoV-2 (Aim 2). Last, he will recruit a longitudinal cohort of SARS-Cov-2 and determine the frequency of complications and long-term outcomes after recovery (Aim 3). This mentored research experience will furnish Dr. Oliveira with skills and expertise in various aspects of clinical epidemiology, including the establishment of surveillance systems, conducting longitudinal studies, computer programing, and executing sophisticated analyses of the longitudinal data. Workshops, semester- long courses will complement this practical experience, and one-on-one mentorship by a multidisciplinary team of established, independently funded, internationally respected investigators and pioneers in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, biomedical informatics, and mathematical modeling. After this work, Dr. Oliveira will have produced important science that could improve the care of all the children affected by this pandemic. Furthermore, he will have gained a unique set of skills and built the necessary infrastructure that will allow him to establish a research program integrating the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and informatics to detect, prevent, and respond to future pandemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fear of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is widespread, and the emotional toll of this virus on our society is enormous. However, relatively little is known about the effects of this virus on children. Empiric estimates on the risks and long-term effects of this virus in children will enable clinicians and policymakers to make informed decisions about both the need for optimal use of preventative and therapeutic interventions as they become available.",Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C,10191775,K23AI159518,"['18 year old', '2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 surveillance', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric epidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'State Hospitals', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'data access', 'design', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'structured data', 'surveillance data', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188457
"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data",10116483,R01MH119177,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Data', 'Death Certificates', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'demographics', 'detection method', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'implementation study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'model design', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric emergency', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'validation studies']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,686186
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,10146274,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2021,118800
"Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.  The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression. Use of computational modeling will enable identification of neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with greater treatment response, and may guide future personalization of psychotherapy.",Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression,10191051,K23MH123864,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'geriatric depression', 'geriatric major depression', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'middle age', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'psychoeducation', 'random forest', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'skills', 'social', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,191063
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,10198671,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'support vector machine', 'tic suppression', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,626493
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Children ABSTRACT About 55% of children with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. Treatments are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. This study aims to conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children. The first task of the study will focus on the implementation of a predictive model to identify symptomatic children with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s) or treatments initiated. The tool identifies patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Using this predictive algorithm, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). Children with (1) a new mental health diagnosis but no treatment initiated; (2) a new mental health medication ordered with no mental health diagnosis; and (3) symptoms identified by the predictive model with no new mental health diagnosis or treatment initiated will be recruited. The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, and reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed. The primary outcome is the percentage of youth initiating psychotherapy. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with at least 4 mental health visits. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use compared to the control arm. We will also assess initiation of psychotropic medications. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention (“dose” of navigation) received. NARRATIVE Mental illnesses often first appear in childhood and yet go mostly untreated until a serious disorder develops. This study will (a) implement ways to identify early mental health needs in children 4-12 years of age using free text notes entered into medical records, and (b) carry out a two-arm randomized trial to test if offering navigator support and video-based psychotherapy result in more mental health visits over a 6-month period of time.",Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Children,10094734,R01MH124652,"['12 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appointment', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Social Workers', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adjudication', 'arm', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care providers', 'child mental health service', 'comparison intervention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'outreach', 'peer', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'random forest', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'structured data', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'trial design', 'urgent care', 'usual care arm', 'video visit', 'waiver']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,810761
"Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning Abstract This application will combine the strengths of two large scale NIH-funded initiatives to understand disorder- related patterns in the human brain: Connectomes Related to Human Disease (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA). We will develop and evaluate novel brain vulnerability metrics - based on the idea of polygenic risk scores – that we expect to better predict diagnosis and cognitive performance than standard neuroimaging measures. We define a metric of “vulnerability” by quantifying the similarity between each individual's brain pattern and deficit patterns in neuropsychiatric disorders. The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) uses Big Data meta-analyses to quantify the similarity between an individual and meta-analytical deficit effect size patterns based on large and diverse international samples. The Machine Learning-Vulnerability Index (MVI) is trained using Big Data mega-analytic samples to quantify the similarity for individual brain patterns to those learned from patients and controls. We will compute novel, cross-domain vulnerability metrics to phenotype each of the N=3,350 CHRD individuals across three mainly psychiatric (schizophrenia-spectrum and psychosis disorder, major depression, and bipolar disorder), three mainly neurological (epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease) and three neuroimaging domains (structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI). Our Specific Aims merge CRHD and ENIGMA data to test four hypotheses: 1) Neuropsychiatric illnesses not only impact an isolated region or circuit, but are associated with deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that can be unique to each illness; 2) such deficit patterns are informative of cognitive deficits in patients; 3) similarity with the deficit patterns will have higher specificity and sensitivity than any traditional neuroimaging metric or trait; and 4) similarity at the voxel- and vertex-based level may lead to development of high-resolution vulnerability indices. We will test these hypotheses by performing patient-control sensitivity and specificity analyses in the corresponding CRHD illness groups; study the degree of separation vs. commonality across psychiatric and neurological disorders; and evaluate pattern differences at specific stages of the illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease. We will use multivariate mediation analyses to link vulnerability to variance in cognitive domains ascertained by CHRD. This short, intensive project will benefit the community-at-large by populating the CHRD/HCP database with novel multimodal brain phenotypes extracted and homogenized using standard ENIGMA workflows, enriched with Open Science approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE The Connectomes Related to Human Disease/Human Connectome Project (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) are two large scale NIH-funded initiatives exploring disorder-related patterns in the human brain. The two projects are complementary: CRHD focuses on in-depth, high-resolution multimodal phenotyping of the brain connectome in modest samples, whereas ENIGMA's analyses harness the statistical power of large and inclusive, worldwide samples. We propose combining the strengths of CRHD and ENIGMA to test novel biomarkers based on replicable and consistent illness deficit patterns provided by Big Data studies. We posit that major brain illnesses do not impact an isolated region or brain circuit but rather lead to deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that are shared or unique to an illness; such deficit patterns are highly replicable and linked to severity, duration and treatment resistance. We will develop and evaluate a multivariate vulnerability model based on (1) the degree of similarity between an individual's brain patterns and expected disorder patterns defined as a linear combination of deficits - conceptually similar to polygenic risk scores - and (2) a vulnerability metric computed using machine learning. We will test the specificity and sensitivity of these models against the single most discriminative neuroimaging traits in six diagnostic categories shared by CRHD and ENIGMA: schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) and psychosis, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorders (BP), epilepsy (EP), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will use multivariate analyses to compare sensitivity and specificity of the regional vulnerability index (RVI) and machine learning vulnerability (MVI) in separating patients and controls in the CHRD samples, mapping unique and shared deficit patterns across six diagnostic categories. We will link vulnerability metrics to cognitive outcomes and diagnosis using mediation analyses. Finally, we will enrich vulnerability models with CHRD's connectomics based phenotypes including cortical myelination to advance white matter integrity measurements for future large-scale ENIGMA studies.",Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning,10186960,RF1MH123163,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heritability', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cognitive performance', 'connectome', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'imaging approach', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'open data', 'polygenic risk score', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,RF1,2021,1220179
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES,10304211,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'social stressor', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2021,487253
"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health. Bi- directional communication through the Community Engagement Core helps set the research agenda of the CEET and inform public health decision making.",Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology,10189586,P30ES013508,"['Address', 'Air Pollution', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asbestos', 'Award', 'Beer', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biosensor', 'Cities', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Philadelphia', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Superfund', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'career', 'career development', 'cheminformatics', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental toxicology', 'exposed human population', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'improved', 'lead exposure', 'medical schools', 'member', 'next generation', 'phenome', 'professor', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'urban area', 'wasting']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2021,1606329
"Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from Dr. Lorenzo Pasquini, a postdoctoral scholar in clinical neuroimaging at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlying socioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background in neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research and high-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training and research program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms among elderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiological recordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grant applications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor, Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomic and socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, a computational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy and psychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning. This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic system and the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neural systems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiology underlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brain network organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1). Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assess the neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize on multimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy older controls to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior (Exploratory Aim 3). The proposed training will allow Dr. Pasquini to develop a scientific niche and conduct his research with world-class mentorship, paving the way for his career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neurobiological basis of socioemotional symptoms, a debilitating feature of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, is not well understood. The brain and autonomic nervous system cohesively interact to support socioemotional well-being, and cutting-edge analytical techniques can now reveal the rich dynamic properties of these systems. By leveraging behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease of socioemotional deficits that targets these systems, the goal of the proposed project is to determine how autonomic and functional brain network dynamics shape human emotions and social behavior in healthy and clinical populations.",Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function,10227218,K99AG065457,"['Affective Symptoms', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'career', 'cohesion', 'dynamic system', 'fundamental research', 'geriatric neuropsychiatry', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2021,125010
"Precision mapping of individualized executive networks in youth ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) improves dramatically during childhood and adolescence, and failures of EF are associated with both a broad range of negative outcomes and diverse mental illnesses. The brain circuits responsible for EF are spatially distributed, and include the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and salience systems. These networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a straightforward mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However, multiple independent efforts in adults using precision functional mapping techniques have recently demonstrated that there is marked inter-individual variation in functional topography, which is defined as the spatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that individual variation in functional topography is a critical determinant of EF in youth. Our collaborative team recently published the first report of individualized functional networks in children using a cross-sectional sample (Cui et al., Neuron 2020). In this proposal, we will build upon this initial work by replicating and generalizing this finding using two large cross-sectional datasets with high-resolution imaging: the Healthy Brain Network (HBN; n=5,000) and Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D, n=1,300). Critically, we will also leverage the unprecedented resources of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study (ABCD, n=11,572) to delineate within-subject change in personalized networks. In this proposal, we will first harmonize these massive data resources using advanced techniques originally developed for statistical genomics (Aim 1). Next, we will describe how personalized networks evolve with age (Aim 2) and predict EF (Aim 3). Finally, we will use machine learning tools to discover how the functional topography of personalized executive networks predict dimensions of psychopathology in a data-driven manner (Exploratory Aim 4). Throughout, we will adhere to best practices of open science to maximize reproducibility, and ensure that all processed data, code, and results are openly shared with the neuroscience community. Together, this research will establish that functional topography is essential for understanding EF, and will motivate trials of personalized neuromodulatory therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during childhood, and executive dysfunction is associated with risk taking behaviors, a broad range of negative outcomes, and psychiatric illness. A greater understanding of individual variation in brain networks that support executive function may be critical for the development of personalized interventions in diverse conditions. These novel clinical interventions would benefit the public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Precision mapping of individualized executive networks in youth,10178201,R37MH125829,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'support network', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational study']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R37,2021,818531
"Improving the performance of an AI-enabled clinical decision support tool for detecting suicidal risk and other mental health concerns PROJECT SUMMARY—Clarigent Health is refining an AI-enabled clinical decision support tool that uses linguistic and acoustic patterns in recorded patient interviews to identify patients at risk of harm due to suicidal ideation or other mental health concerns. In an ongoing study, Clarigent is collecting > 6,000 patient interviews from adolescents and adults in schools, primary care offices, and other settings to improve risk prediction and refine the platform for data collection and reporting. Prior studies indicate the tool will have broad clinical utility, but the impacts of patient characteristics and interview setting on the tool’s performance are unknown. Characterizing these effects would support tailored models, inform prospective trials, and aid in selecting the correct regulatory pathways and settings for deployment. Further development is expected to provide a rapid and reliable objective assessment of suicidal ideation and other actionable mental health concerns to reduce loss of life and improve mental health among adolescents and adults. Each year, ~13% of adolescents and 7% of adults in the US experience a major depressive episode. Many contemplate or attempt suicide, resulting in > 45,000 deaths. Early risk identification and treatment could prevent many of these, but at- risk individuals rarely receive screening until symptoms are severe. Universal screening and diagnostic tools deployed in schools and physicians’ offices could address this problem, but the lack of an objective risk assessment tool for use in these settings is a major barrier. In the absence of blood-based or genetic biomarkers, verbal and nonverbal language cues can be used to identify risk. The complexity and broad variability of these thought markers resists easy classification by a clinician, but AI approaches can identify consistent, meaningful patterns. Two trials have demonstrated the ability of AI-enabled algorithms to use linguistic and acoustic features of a brief interview to correctly categorize suicide risk. Clarigent, which was formed to further develop and commercialize this technology for use in diverse settings, is collecting > 6,000 patient interviews to improve the performance of this tool for predicting suicidality, depression, and anxiety. This Phase I SBIR will assess the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographic area, or interview environment on model performance; validate modified models; and inform key decisions regarding commercialization path and future trial designs. Aim 1. Characterize the effects of patient and setting characteristics on model performance. Factors that improve model performance by ≥ 0.05 AUC will be considered for separate model development. Aim 2. Validate updated algorithms with a holdout data set. Successful models will correctly classify risk categories with an AUC ≥ 0.80. Milestones for Progression to Phase II—The goal is to identify patient or setting characteristics that improve model performance ≥ 0.05 AUC. Models that correctly classify risk categories with an AUC ≥ 0.80 will be advanced for evaluation in prospective trials. Clarigent will consult with FDA and advisors to determine the correct regulatory path depending on model performance and intended use. PROJECT NARRATIVE The availability of a clinical decision support tool that predicts suicidal ideation, depression, and other mental health concerns prior to an emergency situation is a critical advance for human health.

"Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation. Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact, and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric, substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial (BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.  Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim 1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array) and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease. Cognitive and mood disorders occur more commonly in people with HIV than in the general population but the field still does not fully understand why and has no effective therapies for most of those who are affected. This project will take a new approach to understanding how cognition, mood, substance use, and medical characteristics cluster together and will identify new biological mechanisms associated with these conditions. The successful project could lead to new diagnostic tests and therapies for these disorders, which would have substantial public health relevance.",Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER,10161628,R01MH125720,"['AIDS dementia', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain imaging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Store', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gut associated lymphoid tissue', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'disease classification', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'gut dysbiosis', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,708875
"Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships Project Summary Infants communicate to their caregivers that they need food by crying. This represents our very first social interaction that lays the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing a strong social bond with caregivers. Infants that cannot regulate their nutrition are at risk for malnourishment or obesity, whose deleterious effects will negatively impact the wellness of these individuals for their lifetime. Abnormalities in social recognition and communication, like those found in autism spectrum disorders, also become apparent during infancy. Despite the critical importance of infants communicating nutritional need to caregivers, the neuronal basis remains unknown. To address this deficit, I propose to study social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing. Tadpoles use this begging display to encode nutritional state, enabling us to quantify hunger- based communication. These tadpoles are translucent, allowing us to visualize the development and activity of neurons in the brain. I am combining this novel model system and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to interrogate the neuronal substrates of hunger-based communication. I will examine whether nutritional quality influences the development of neurons that regulating feeding and communication with in vivo brain imaging. I will also test for a functional role of these neuronal cell-types in begging behavior using a high throughput behavior assay, whole brain clearing and immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific manipulations of neuronal activity. As social recognition is important for establishing parent-offspring bonds, I will then use in vivo neural activity imaging to determine how tadpoles recognize their parents using multi-modal sensory integration. Completion of these experiments will transform our understanding of a social behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing. There is a pressing need for this research because there are currently no established models for studying the neural mechanisms of infant communication of hunger. This work is important to public health because some of the most prevalent disorders afflicting children in the United States are eating related disorders and conditions involving abnormalities in social recognition and communication, such as autism spectrum disorders. More research on infant feeding and communication is needed to better understand these pathologies in the youngest members of our society. Narrative Communication of nutritional need during infancy is our very first social interaction, laying the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing strong social bonds with caregivers. The proposed work uses a unique biological model – social tadpoles that communicate nutritional need to their caregivers – to uncover how infants evaluate their nutritional state, recognize their caregivers, and communicate that they need food. These studies have implications for informing preventative strategies and treatments for childhood obesity and autism spectrum disorders, two of the most prevalent diseases afflicting the youngest members of our society.",Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships,10263607,DP2HD102042,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Critical Thinking', 'Crying', 'Dancing', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Eating', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Life', 'Methodology', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Study models', 'Tadpoles', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'member', 'multimodality', 'neurogenetics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity in children', 'offspring', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social attachment', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,86547
"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD.",Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study,10127376,K01MH122774,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'associated symptom', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'data fusion', 'design', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'individualized medicine', 'large datasets', 'memory process', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'trauma exposure', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment research', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2021,176916
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743
"Automated Mental Health Referral System This proposal addresses a significant barrier to obtaining treatment for college-age  youth with mental disorders. Many college-age youth with impairing mental disorders  remain untreated because of concerns about stigma and privacy, inconvenience and wait times, and  because universities are often unable to service all such students. Also, of critical importance,  when referral for treatment is implemented, it is without regard to the person's pathology,  because of the erroneous assumption that treatment need not be tailored to the  individual. This proposal aims to address this critical clinical issue. We advance that a  sophisticated automated online referral system would resolve all of these problems, but there is no  expert-trained system for psychiatric referrals. We propose to automate the referral process,  designed for college-age youth, by bridging online, mental health assessments and curated,  up-to-date, mental health provider networks. To this end, the non-profit Child Mind  1nstitute is partnering with the for-profit MiResource. Assessment expertise is provided  by the Child Mind Institute, which treats children and adolescents with mental health  disorders, conducts mental health research, has acquired large assessment datasets, has in-house  expertise in mental health assessment, and through its MATTER lab has developed novel assessment  technologies such as the Mindlogger data collection and assessment platform. Referral  infrastructure is provided by MiResource, a software-as-a-service solution designed to help  universities connect students to local mental health providers. The MATTER lab and MiResource  will develop an automated online assessment and referral platform that uses expert-trained  machine learning to provide users with personalized referrals for mental health care.  Expert referrals will be based on the six dimensions of the level of Care Utilization System (risk  of harm, functional status, comorbidity, environment, treatment history, and attitude)  applied to college students' responses to mental health assessments. 1n Phase 1, we will (1-1)  build mental health assessments into the Mindlogger platform, (1-2) build an expert  referral collection interface, and (1-3) set up a machine learning pipeline for training and  testing an updatable classification model for automated clinically appropriate, personalized  referrals. 1n Phase 11, we will build, refine, and clinically validate our  product for commercialization. Specifically, we will (11-1) validate the Phase I framework on a  university population, (11-2) integrate Mindlogger's assessments into MiResource, and (11-3)  conduct usability and quality assurance tests of the new Mindlogger plus MiResource platform,   to get feedback about issues related to accessibility, relevance, accuracy, and esthetics,  and incorporate solutions in response to this feedback into a final version. College-age youth do not have easy access to expert referral coordinators to get  referrals to appropriate mental health care, due to the stigma of seeing a referral coordinator  in-person, long wait times to get an intake appointment in the university counseling center,  or limited or no referral counselors available in their higher-education institution. We  propose to automate the referral process, focusing on college-age youth, by bridging online  assessments and curated, up-to-date mental health provider networks.

"Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY There are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Individual-level risk factors do not fully explain the observed disparities. There is increasing evidence for the role of area-level racial bias in explaining these disparities, but we currently lack both the measures, methods, and findings to empirically evaluate its influence. The proposed research will advance the research in all 3 areas. We will be using online and social media data and machine learning models to create two measures of area-level racial bias and implement a robust research design to determine whether area-level racial bias impacts birth outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, health disparities, machine learning, social media data, biostatistics, and community engaged research—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are to 1) track and detect changes in area-level racial bias and identify local and national race-related events during these time points, 2) determine the impact of changes in area-level racial bias on changes in adverse birth outcomes, and 3) identify protective factors for adverse birth outcomes. Because our data is collected repeatedly and finely across the United States, we can explicitly account for temporal trends and place effects. The proposed study uses new data to capture trends in racial bias with sophisticated machine learning models, and represents a critical advancement in the investigation of racial disparities in birth outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individual-level risk factors are not fully explaining the large and persistent racial disparities in birth outcomes, limiting policy and intervention strategies to reduce these disparities. This project will advance our understanding of the potential effects of racial bias at a population level on the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight and identify protective factors to buffer its impact.",Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes.,10096177,R01MD015716,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'Birth Weight', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Focus Groups', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural experiment', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Prejudice', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Site', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Work', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'neural network', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial bias', 'racial discrimination', 'racial disparity', 'racial identity', 'racism', 'resilience', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'stressor', 'trend']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,738087
"Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors Project Summary/Abstract Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among young adults have reached a crisis level, especially for those in the LGBTQ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning and/or transgender) population, who face social stigma in addition to the typical developmental challenges. Although we know the general risk factors for suicide, those have limited utility in predicting how, when, and in whom suicide occurs. It is critically important to consider the role of social context because STB often occurs in response to a recent social threat event such as rejection and could be more likely in those who have altered sensitivity of neural social circuitry. The proposed R01 study in response to RFA MH-20-327 builds on social models such as Minority Stress Theory and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and examines social risk factors of STB from distal to proximal levels. The overarching goal is to predict change in STB, including cumulative intensity of STB and transition from suicidal thoughts to behaviors, on a time scale from hours to days to months. We propose that in LGBTQ young adults, STB occurs through social processing and regulation of socially generated negative affect (e.g., shame). Specifically, we examine the distal vulnerability factors of sensitivity in social brain circuitry and negative urgency, or the tendency toward impulsive behavior in the face of painful negative affect, and the proximal, time-varying factors of sleep dysregulation and social experiences (e.g., rejection). The study will test the association of these distal and proximal factors with STB; differences in these factors between LGBTQ young adults with vs. without STB; the interplay of distal and proximal factors; and the role of LGBTQ-related characteristics (e.g., victimization, outness) in STB. The study will include 130 participants age 18-30, all of whom identify as LGBTQ and 2/3 of whom have recurrent suicidal ideation and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. Participants will complete a detailed interview of STB, an fMRI scan using social threat paradigms, a 3-month protocol of actigraphy and smartphone-based assessment, and a follow-up interview at 6 months. Smartphone data will include ecological momentary assessment of social threat experiences and STB, as well as passively collected sensor data (e.g., social media app use, texting activity). Traditional and machine learning quantitative techniques will be applied to determine contributions of distal and proximal factors to STB (e.g., occurrence of suicidal behavior), individual differences in risk factors, and contributions of neural, sleep, social, clinical, and demographic factors to STB. The study will elucidate the role of modifiable risk factors in STB and have relevance to clinical neuroscience, suicidology, and prevention efforts. Project Narrative Suicide in LGBTQ young adults has reached a crisis level, but our ability to predict and prevent suicide has not improved in 50 years. We will use brain imaging, actigraphy, and smartphone technology to measure critical social precipitants of suicidality and their interaction with general risk factors. With machine learning, a technique based on artificial intelligence, we will combine these sources of data to determine the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors develop over hours, days, and months.",Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors,10106761,R01MH124900,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Face', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hotlines', 'Hour', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Same-sex', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'actigraphy', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain circuitry', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'family support', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'health disparity', 'longitudinal design', 'modifiable risk', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'queer', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'sleep quality', 'smartphone based assessment', 'social', 'social media', 'social model', 'social stigma', 'suicidal behavior', 'theories', 'trait', 'transgender', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,754061
"Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice ABSTRACT: Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the “Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks. Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory- inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within- region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress has a central role in mental health conditions and improved understanding of how stress affects brain and body could deliver great potential clinical impact. To determine the brain and body responses to varying stressors we will use novel instrumentation to measure 50+ behavioral metrics at sub-second resolution together with multi-brain site electrophysiology over weeks. We will then determine how varying stressors affect circadian and broader changes across animal behavior and physiology as well as neural circuit dynamics.",Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice,10199475,R01MH126137,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diet Habits', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'REM Sleep', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Solid', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Sucrose', 'Suggestion', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'circadian', 'cohesion', 'data structure', 'digital', 'field study', 'forced swim test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stressor', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,681455
"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning.

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,10065509,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Well Child Visits', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2021,605422
"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613
"Mechanisms and Predictors of Change in App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years. Headspace – among the most popular of these platforms – has over 42 million users. Recent surveys indicate that 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with anxiety or depressive symptoms, which increase substantially during the adolescent years. A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed, which are strongly aligned with the NCCIH Strategic Plan: (1) what are the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an app-delivered mindfulness course vs. an active control condition and will complete pre- and post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional connectivity within – and between – brain networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination (i.e., Default Mode Network and Salience Network). In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally, mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol developed in the PI’s lab. First, we will test whether changes in (1) brain functional connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills mediate between-group (i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, we will test whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training. Recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting outcome at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Ultimately, such an algorithm may inform individual risk-benefit assessments that could be used to objectively communicate the probability of experiencing positive vs. adverse outcomes to users prior to engaging with a mindfulness app. Collectively, results are expected to advance (1) our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of app-based mindfulness training and (2) our ability to predict which adolescents are well-suited to these increasingly popular apps. Project Narrative Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years (e.g., the Headspace app has over 42 million users). An estimated 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with symptoms of depression and anxiety, which increase substantially during the adolescent years, and which have been repeatedly linked to rumination in youth.

"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.

"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,10067371,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2021,41249
"Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder Project Summary Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms, combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically, we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD, using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions, providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient- psychotherapist interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both borderline and avoidant personality disorders are marked by profound impairments in interpersonal functioning. However, the brain mechanisms underlying these social deficits are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better elucidate how the brain is involved in complex social interactions and the clinical relevance of these processes for personality disorders.","Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder",10234509,R01MH123069,"['Assertiveness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer framework', 'geometric structure', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,648979
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts characterized by difficulty discarding seemingly worthless objects. This study will identify risk-factors for developing troublesome hoarding by integrating and analyzing clinical interviews and a web-based registry of adults that includes various medical and cognitive questionnaires and neurocognitive tests.",Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding,10253596,R01MH117114,"['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain Health Registry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compulsive Hoarding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Impairment', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Low income', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Self Assessment', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Unemployment', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computing resources', 'disability', 'frailty', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'recruit', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,68363
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,10231183,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,236443
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10067383,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,765655
"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD.

"3/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health factors, such as employment and educational attainment, can increase the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, as well as (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will generate new data in improving our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,10164762,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Small Intestines', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'dietary', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'epithelium regeneration', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tissue injury', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2021,192552
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'excessive weight gain', 'feasibility testing', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2021,139614
"Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling The human brain is an unimaginably complicated system of interconnected neurons that is capable of complex thought, emotion and behavior. Macroscale white matter connections quantified via the structural connectome (SC) act as the backbone for the flow of functional activation, which can be represented via the functional con- nectome (FC). Our group and others have shown that quantifying properties of the brain’s structural and func- tional connectomes and their relationship can inform understanding of brain-behavior associations and disease mechanisms4-9. However, models that describe SC-FC relationships have only achieved moderate agreement with observations and have not been used to fully explore the heritability and cognitive implications of structure- function coupling in adult and developing populations. If we do not accurately understand how the brain’s anat- omy and physiology are linked across the human lifespan, then we will not be able to quantify the impact of disease or pathological developmental trajectories. Our long-term goal is to create computational tools for stud- ying the brain’s structure and function, particularly in the context of disease. The overarching objective of this project is to create a model that accurately {and interpretably} quantifies the coupling between the structural and functional connectomes in both sexes, which will in turn allow us to investigate the heritability and cognitive implications of SC-FC coupling across developing and adult populations. Our central hypothesis is that a {hybrid approach to predicting FC from SC, combining both biophysical modeling and deep learning,} will be more ac- curate than existing techniques. Based on the prior literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SC- FC coupling will vary with sex, be heritable, associated with development, and explain inter-subject variability in cognition. Our hypothesis is supported by preliminary data from our group and others that show SC-FC relation- ships are heritable and vary with sex and cognition in patients7,18. The rationale for this work is that having an accurate model of the SC-FC relationship in healthy populations, which currently does not exist, will further our understanding of the complex relationship between anatomy, physiology, sex, genetics and cognition. We will test the central hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) identify the most accurate model for predicting FC from SC, 2) quantify the heritability of SC-FC coupling and its association with cognitive performance and 3) characterize the SC-FC coupling trajectory and its cognitive implications throughout development. We will use neuroimaging, genetic and cognitive data from the Human Connectome Project, including young adult (~1000 individuals, 22- 37 years) and developing populations (~650 individuals, 5-21 years). The approach is innovative, as it proposes to use model-driven, data-driven and hybrid approaches to model SC-FC relationships and that it poses to ex- plore sex effects, heritability, cognitive and developmental implications of SC-FC relationships. The proposed research is significant in that understanding structure-function relationships across typical development will allow quantification of the impact of disease and reveal avenues for novel treatments in various neurological diseases. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the relationship between brain anatomy, physiology, genetics and cognition throughout human development is paramount to understanding of how it can break down in disease. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NICHD's mission in that it seeks to understand human development and optimize abilities for all.",Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling,10189014,RF1MH123232,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sex Differences', 'Ships', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genome-wide', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,RF1,2021,1292521
"Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube PROJECT SUMMARY E-cigarette use among U.S. youth is a significant public health problem. Understanding youth appeal of e- cigarettes and marketing strategies targeting youth is critical to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s goal to prevent youth e-cigarette use. A significant youth appeal is the ability to modify e-cigarettes or to “hack” the devices or e-liquid constituents for unintended purposes (e.g., using at higher temperatures or for a longer period of time, adding their own e-liquids made with nicotine or THC oil). However, it is largely unknown how youth modify e-cigarette devices or their components, their perceptions of these behaviors, and marketing strategies used to endorse these behaviors. YouTube, a popular social media, can be examined to understand modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing associated with these behaviors. The overall goal of this study is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or “hack” the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim. The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified, restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on YouTube, and develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of engaging in these behaviors.",Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube,10170329,R01DA049878,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine', 'Oils', 'Perception', 'Plug-in', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Toxicology', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'demographics', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic liquid', 'experience', 'male', 'marijuana vaping', 'novel', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'sex', 'social', 'social media', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco regulatory science', 'vaping', 'web site']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,444903
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,10063830,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'statistical and machine learning', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'underserved community', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,643165
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis). Changes in frontal-temporal regions/circuitry and neurocognitive measures over time will be examined together using novel approaches (e.g., machine learning) to predict diagnostic group, symptom severity, and functional outcome for the identification of key factors associated with risk and resilience in the SZ spectrum.",Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum,10123002,R01MH121411,"['Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'causal model', 'early onset', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'longitudinal course', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'white matter']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,796941
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,10087504,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'substance use treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2021,158923
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,10153459,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'efficacious treatment', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,692058
"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects. Findings of our study will ultimately result in precision risk assessment and precision prevention strategies to improve human health worldwide.",Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment,10109116,R01ES031322,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '4 year old', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrazine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family health status', 'Food Supply', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herbicides', 'Human', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Insecticides', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paraquat', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pentachlorophenol', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Phenotype', 'Phorate', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probiotics', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water Supply', 'acaricide', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'brain tissue', 'carcinogenesis', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'drinking water', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'glyphosate', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'individualized prevention', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbial composition', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome sequencing', 'motor behavior', 'mouse model', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pesticide exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sample collection', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2021,281700
"When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments. As these diseases progress, the person with dementia (PWD) becomes increasingly dependent on a caregiver for functional, psychological, and economic assistance. It is well-documented that caring for a PWD is associated with considerable declines in health and well-being. Evidence suggests that many caregivers continue to experience these adverse effects for years after caregiving has ended (after the death of the PWD), though this area has received less attention. There is also striking variability in the extent to which caregivers experience these consequences – both during caregiving and after it has ended. Research on the sources of these individual differences has largely focused on factors related to the external environment, the PWD, or the caregiver that contribute to increased vulnerability in caregivers. Although research has linked PWD-caregiver relationship quality with declines in caregiver well-being, little is known about the specific interpersonal mechanisms that contribute to caregiver outcomes. For example, the positive emotional qualities of the PWD-caregiver social connection may buffer against the negative effects of caregiving stress, whereas lower quality social connection may drive increases in caregivers’ loneliness. In the proposed research, I will measure PWD-caregiver social connection through observational measures derived from basic affective science, including dyadic coding of emotional behavior in a laboratory-based interaction between PWDs and caregivers (Study 1; N = 186) and text analysis of emotional language caregivers used when describing a recent time they felt connected to the PWD (Study 2; N = 533). I will then determine the impact of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being (Aim 1), both concurrently (in current caregivers) and longitudinally (in former caregivers, after caregiving has ended). Additionally, I will compare the relative strength of these associations between current and former caregivers, and I will investigate possible mechanisms (e.g., loneliness) through which PWD-caregiver social connection is linked to caregivers’ health and well-being. I will then evaluate the predictive value of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being, above and beyond an optimal set of predictors identified through machine learning (Aim 2). The proposed dissertation research will prepare me to conduct future studies investigating the socioemotional mechanisms that may influence caregivers’ health trajectories. This F31 will provide the necessary support to accomplish the following research goals: (1) to further expertise in basic affective science methodologies (e.g., dyadic behavioral coding, text analysis); (2) to achieve advanced proficiency in statistical techniques for longitudinal and machine learning analyses; and (3) to enhance knowledge of neurodegenerative disease, including neuropsychology and differential diagnosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dementia and other neurodegenerative disease are progressive, debilitating illnesses that require assistance from loved ones serving as caregivers. Caring for a person with dementia is associated with significantly heightened risk for adverse consequences, such as reduced health and well-being, which may persist for years after caregiving has ended. Identifying mechanisms that convey risk for the long-term adverse effects of caregiving can facilitate developing more effective interventions with major public health benefits.",When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being,10235400,F31AG072891,"['Accounting', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ecosystem', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'caregiving', 'dementia caregiving', 'effective intervention', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'loved ones', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'social', 'social relationships']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,46036
"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics. The outcome of the work will inform how emotions should be conceptualized within a broader research framework of mental health domains.",Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation,10227196,R01MH124112,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'data repository', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'movie', 'negative affect', 'neural network architecture', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,774017
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Neural Circuit Mechanisms Mediating TMS and Oxytocin Effects on Social Cognition We are requesting an increase in the yearly direct costs to support the aims of the MERIT renewal. What we propose is a dramatic leap into the future of social neuroscience and lies at the bleeding edge of current technology. The proposed research is innovative, ambitious, and necessary for understanding how primate, and by extension human, brains enable appropriate social behavior in the real world. Our proposal advances understanding of how primate brains generate appropriate social behavior through a tightly-integrated, ambitious set of 4 specific aims combining simultaneous wireless neurophysiological recordings in multiple freely-moving monkeys interacting naturally in varied social contexts, semi-to-fully-automated quantification of social behavior using computer vision, pharmacological manipulations, and reversible perturbations of neural activity. To our knowledge, none of these experiments has ever been attempted in macaques. Our pilot data compellingly demonstrate that we can do it. n/a",Neural Circuit Mechanisms Mediating TMS and Oxytocin Effects on Social Cognition,10295974,R37MH109728,"['Aggressive behavior', 'Ally', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Argipressin', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Eating', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Ethology', 'Evaluation', 'Facial Expression', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Future', 'Game Theory', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grooming', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Mathematics', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motivation', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oxytocin', 'Peptides', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological Processes', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Same-sex', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Update', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'contagion', 'drinking', 'electrical microstimulation', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'fighting', 'frontal lobe', 'human-in-the-loop', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'microstimulation', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'social attention', 'social cognition', 'social group', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'success']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R37,2021,768682
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,10130001,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,728998
"Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth? PROJECT SUMMARY While researchers continue to study the effects of disproportionate minority contact with law enforcement on a range of health-related outcomes, a recent review of this work questions the methodological validity of most studies on this topic. Many of these concerns focus on (a) unrealistic assumptions about police behavior and (b) poor quality data. This project addresses both by introducing a human development based model of law enforcement officer (LEO) behavior and applying this model to study how LEOs identify with male minority youth (MMY) using a novel publicly available data source: broadcast police communications (BPC). Our long-term goals are (1) to assess the viability of BPC for understanding how LEOs perceive MMY both “in the moment” via the pre-reflective procedural language used before and during LEO-MMY encounters and “at rest” via development of a survey instrument measuring LEO identification with minority youth, and (2) to determine if BPC may be used in lieu of non-public data sources to study police behavior by developing a novel computational strategy for extracting meaningful information from BPC via, among other strategies, a first-of-its-kind automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and large scale (>100 hours) training corpus of transcribed BPC for use by computational social scientists and ASR researchers. Our previous research revealed that a complex set of psychosocial mechanisms govern the developmental trajectories of MMYs, indicating MMYs adopt reactive coping strategies to particular stressful events (e.g. encounters with police) that can be maladaptive (e.g. hypermasculinity) depending on context of interactions. Our work also suggests that all humans are subject to similar processes. Since the outcomes of LEO-MMY encounters are ultimately the responsibility of LEOs, this project seeks to improve the quality of these encounters (i.e. reduce youth trauma) by studying a little acknowledged LEO reactive coping strategy: the character of procedural language used to provide LEOs with incident-specific information via BPC. This conceptual approach derives from our theoretical framing (i.e. Spencer’s phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory, or PVEST) that highlights the development and utilization of reactive coping strategies in response—particularly—to MMY associated stress. It is our premise that BPC can prime LEOs to inaccurately interpret the behavior of MMY as threatening, increasing the potential for adverse events. Such inaccurate assessments are hard to combat since LEOs are acting on the best information available. As a result, the procedural language of BPC pose unacknowledged risks to the well- being of MMY. This study will thus perform a first-of-its-kind analysis of BPC to simultaneously assess its viability for determining racial discrimination in policing and develop a novel survey instrument measuring LEOs ability to identify with MMY for use by researchers and policing organizations across the country. Public Health Relevance / Project Narrative Across the United States, adverse events involving law enforcement officers (LEOs) and male minority youth (MMY) and the toxic stress associated with repeated negative LEO-MMY encounters raise compelling public health concerns about racial discrimination in policing. The proposed research addresses these concerns by (a) introducing a novel human development paradigm for the study of police behavior that focuses on how and to what extent LEOs identify with MMY and (b) assessing the technological viability of using broadcast police communications (BPC) for large scale analysis of police behavior, where BPC are analyzed as pre-reflective accounts of LEO thought processes, representing both reactive and stable coping mechanisms (i.e., speech acts) for ensuring the safety of LEOs and the public at large. Accordingly, we propose (1) using this novel data source to understand how LEOs and MMYs come to perceive each other, (2) test a similarly novel survey instrument for measuring LEO identification with minority youth, in the process determining how much meaningful information can be reliably extracted from audio recordings of BPC for identifying racial discrimination in policing without the need to access highly sensitive police records or video recording data.",Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth?,10121621,R01MD015064,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Chicago', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Police', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'Youth', 'acronyms', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'combat', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'course development', 'data quality', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lens', 'male', 'member', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial discrimination', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'social']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,744667
"Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and machine learning (ML) to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying treatment failure in young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD). Young adults are at particularly high risk of OUD and fatal opioid overdose. The monthly injectable extended-release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a highly effective OUD treatment and is particularly well suited for young adults. However, XR-NTX adherence and relapse show considerable individual variability, and the behavioral and clinical factors associated with such variability remain inconclusive. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for multimodal MRI and ML techniques to elucidate the neurocognitive factors that contribute to treatment response beyond behavioral and clinical measures. This project will take advantage of the cutting-edge MRI and ML methods to model brain structures and functions that predict XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD. The study will evaluate 18–34 year-old OUD patients before and during the first three months of XR-NTX treatment, a period associated with the highest rate of dropout from treatment. The primary outcome will be opioid relapse confirmed by weekly urine toxicology and self-report. The secondary outcome will be non-adherence defined as failure to complete the first three injections. The study will focus on five baseline measures of brain structures and functions that are potentially predictive of treatment response: 1) grey matter volume; 2) functional connectivity with the ventral striatum; 3) reactivity to opioid cues; 4) inhibitory control; and 5) self-evaluation. ML techniques will be used to reveal the patterns of brain structures/functions that are associated with each outcome variable. Based on literature and preliminary findings, we anticipate that combining MRI with behavioral and clinical assessments will better account for individual variability in XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD, than using the behavioral and clinical variables alone. The data will unveil novel brain mechanisms that contribute to the risk of treatment failure in this critical population. The project will also serve as a training vehicle for Dr. Zhenhao Shi to improve his clinical and computational skills and facilitate his independent career development. Specifically, it will enable Dr. Shi to achieve five training goals: 1) to advance his knowledge in the methodology of clinical research; 2) to gain hands-on experience in leading clinical projects; 3) to master ML and multivariate methodologies; 4) to apply multimodal MRI techniques to translational and clinical research; and 5) to advance his general independent research skills including leadership, networking, collaboration, scientific writing and grantsmanship. Through a combination of didactic and hands-on activities, the project will fulfill Dr. Shi's training needs and enable his transition to a successful and independent research career in applying advanced computational approaches to the neuroscience research of substance use disorders and their treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques to elucidate the structural and functional brain mechanisms underlying treatment failure in young adults receiving treatment with injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid use disorder. This project will unveil the neural mechanisms underlying individual variability in XR-NTX treatment response in a population of high importance to the efforts to curb the opioid crisis. It will facilitate Dr. Zhenhao Shi's transition to an independent computational addiction neuroscientist and help inform future research of, and intervention strategies for, opioid addiction.",Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction,10214440,K01DA051709,"['Abstinence', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'ROC Curve', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Self-Examination', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2021,179874
"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States.

To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,10122992,R01MH120088,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387064
"Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY In the healthy brain, white matter connections coordinate the speed and reliability of communication among spatially distributed regions. The transmission of neural information with fine temporal precision is crucial for executive function (EF), defined as the coordination of attention, memory, and inhibitory control for goal-directed actions crucial for survival, health, and well-being. Notably, EF undergoes protracted development throughout youth, and the development of executive deficits is present in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and ADHD. However, the degree to which transdiagnostic executive deficits arise due to abnormal development of white matter networks remains unknown. Existing neuroimaging studies of transdiagnostic executive deficits have been limited by 1) inadequate methods to assess neurodevelopmental patterns of spatially distributed brain regions, and 2) inadequate theories of neural communication at the level of macro-scale structural networks. Here we address the latter challenge by generalizing long-established theoretical principles and empirical observations of efficient neurotransmission at the microscale neuron level to the macroscale structural connectome by calculating transmission fidelity. Transmission fidelity models how efficiently a brain region embedded in the structural network can transmit messages to a target region with individually differing speed and reliability. Moreover, we address the former challenge by capitalizing on advances in network science and machine learning. Utilizing these methods is a promising direction for investigating abnormal brain development. In this proposal, we describe the application of a novel analysis of structural network maturation to study the manifestation of transdiagnostic executive deficits. Using a large sample of youth who completed cross-sectional neuroimaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=1,042), our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structural connectivity and EF across age. We will use an additional cross-sectional dataset enriched with youths presenting with psychopathology acquired through the Healthy Brain Network study (n=5,000) to generalize our findings to executive dysfunction. To quantify developmental norms, we will capitalize on our large-scale datasets to train a machine learning model that predicts expected ranges of healthy brain development. Furthermore, understanding within-person changes in brain structure and EF necessitates longitudinal data. We will longitudinally assess youths diagnosed with ADHD (n=50) or schizophrenia (n=50), and typically developing comparators (n=40). In this proposal, we aim to 1) delineate how age-related variation of brain network transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders, and 2) determine how within-individual development in transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction in ADHD and the psychosis spectrum. A better understanding of atypical inter-individual and within-individual developmental patterns of brain networks provides a framework towards precision medicine in neuropsychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individualized therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how developmental deviations from expected norms of brain maturation manifest as psychopathology. We propose to apply a novel method based on network science and machine learning to provide a new perspective on the brain’s developmental patterns that can manifest as executive deficits that span psychopathology. To delineate the typical and atypical development of executive function, we will develop a quantification of within-person longitudinal patterns of brain network maturation contextualized in predictions of developmental norms from unique large-scale neuroimaging datasets of youth.",Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology,10233459,F31MH126569,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Population Study', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'executive function', 'individualized medicine', 'inter-individual variation', 'large scale data', 'mental development', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'transmission process', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
