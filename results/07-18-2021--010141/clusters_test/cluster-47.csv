"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,10085684,R34MH119170,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Service delivery model', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavior test', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dietary', 'digital health', 'disorder risk', 'emotional distress', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'outreach', 'parental involvement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'self help', 'service delivery', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'uptake']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,232006
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,10183334,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translational Research', 'Wireless Technology', 'affiliative behavior', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mature animal', 'microphone', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound', 'source localization', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2021,618061
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis Project Summary/Abstract: The research and training plan for this Fellowship will provide the applicant with significant and foundational training in cognitive neuroscience, advanced computational approaches and neuroimaging analysis to support her long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher dedicated to enhancing functional recovery in schizophrenia. A core feature of schizophrenia is severe disability in social functioning, which places a high burden on individuals and society. Effective treatment development for social functioning deficits is hindered by the lack of well-defined neural and cognitive treatment targets. Recent advances suggest cortical loss in prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be linked to poor functioning in chronic schizophrenia, however the relationship between specific neural targets and social functioning in first episode psychosis (FEP), when individuals may have greater ability to engage in substantial recovery, is largely unknown. Further, social cognition deficits are strongly linked to poor functioning, but the relationship between cortical loss in social cognitive brain regions and social functioning remains to be established. The purpose of this study is to employ data-driven approaches to identify neural and social cognitive markers of social functioning in health and FEP to inform treatment target identification. This cross-sectional, secondary analysis leverages two unique datasets – a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=1113), and a sample of FEP participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Minnesota (n=40). Specific Aim 1 - examine the relationships between gray matter volume and cortical thickness, social cognition and social functioning in healthy young adults using data driven approaches - will answer two research questions: 1a) what brain regions estimate better social functioning in healthy young adults, using regression-based machine learning analysis? and 1b) Is the relationship between social functioning and measures of gray matter volume and cortical thickness mediated by social cognition? We will then translate these findings to an FEP sample in Aim 2 - characterize the relationship between gray matter volume and cortical thickness and social functioning in FEP. This research will be supported by the applicant’s comprehensive training plan, her interdisciplinary mentoring team, and an ideal training environment due to its sophisticated neuroimaging and health informatics resources. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between the brain, social cognition and social functioning, which could lead to more targeted interventions for functional deficits in schizophrenia, alleviating suffering and addressing a critical public health need. The training will position the applicant to continue her trajectory to an independent career in translational cognitive neuroscience to enhance functional recovery through the development of neuroscience-informed interventions. Project Narrative: This research will identify relationships between neural substrate, social cognition and social functioning in healthy and first episode psychosis samples in order to identify the bio-behavioral processes that support social functioning and to identify potential neural treatment targets for improving social functioning deficits in psychotic disorders. This research aligns with the National Institute of Mental Health priority of elucidating the neural processes of complex behaviors to inform novel treatments. Identification of treatment biomarkers for social functioning is critical in order to advance treatment development and optimization for functional deficits in psychosis that will result in significant public health impact by reducing disability and promoting quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis,10153037,F31MH124278,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Development', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'aged', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'connectome', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'first episode psychosis', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social relationships', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'treatment optimization', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2021,41879
"Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a peak onset during adolescence. While interventions are moderately effective for many adolescents, 40 to 70% will relapse within 5 years. Further, MDD relapse predicts academic difficulties, risky behaviors, and suicide. Thus, identifying mechanisms of MDD relapse is critical to clarify intervention targets for this significant public health problem.  During adolescence, social processes and dynamics (especially with peers) are particularly significant, although it is unclear which social processes are most critical to MDD relapse. The present study focuses on the role of social communication, a set of mechanisms involving the receiving and delivery of socially relevant information. Social communication is especially significant to adolescents, as maladaptive social communication can negatively impact the establishment and maintenance of relationships, thus increasing risk for MDD relapse.  For the proposed study, we will employ an NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) lens and use multiple measures (behavior, event-related potentials [ERPs], eye tracking) to compare adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with remitted depression (remMDD; N=200) to healthy controls (HC; N=100) on deficits in several aspects of social communication, including: (i) processing of nonverbal social information, (ii) processing of socioemotional feedback, and (iii) digital communication. First, Aim 1 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process two types of nonverbal social information—facial expressions (as indexed by reduced accuracy and abnormal ERPs [i.e., the N170]) and hand gesturing behaviors (assessed via eye-tracking). Second, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process socioemotional feedback (being accepted versus rejected by same-aged peers), a well-established trigger of adolescent MDD. Specifically, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit a reduced Late Positive Potential [LPP]), an ERP indexing emotional encoding, following positive social feedback from faux peers during a peer evaluation task. Third, using an innovative smartphone app, Aim 3 will collect multiple indicators of digital communication regarding the structure of adolescents’ digital social network (i.e., size of the network; frequency of communication) and sentiment of the communication with their digital social network (i.e., coding sentiment from their texts, social media posts); allowing us to test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit abnormal digital communication. Last, we will follow adolescents for 1-year to determine whether processing of nonverbal information, social feedback, and digital communication predict the escalation of depression symptoms and MDD relapse. Further, supervised machine learning will explore which social communication deficit(s) predict symptoms or MDD relapse, and whether these social processes predict outcomes independent of (or interaction with) other established predictors of relapse (e.g., stressful life events). In summary, the project has the promise to identify social process that contribute to recurrent depression, which, ultimately, will lead to innovative treatment approaches. Project Narrative Depression in adolescence is common and recurrent. While social processes and dynamics are particularly significant in adolescence, it is unclear which social processes are most critical to depression relapse. The present study uses an RDoC “lens” to examine the role of multiple aspects of social communication to determine which social communication deficit predicts the escalation of depression symptoms and relapse during a 1-year follow-up period.",Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression,10064641,R01MH119771,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Social Network', 'Social Processes', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Youth', 'aged', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'negative affect', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'recurrent depression', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'showing emotion', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,720319
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,10138024,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,249264
"Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups Abstract A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research. The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time- consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies. Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression. Narrative The primary goal of this project is to use network analyses to construct a Feeding Interaction Network using automated feeding data collected from animals living in large breeding groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. If successful, these models will identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of fighting and injury. The application of automated feeding data in the social management of captive colonies of rhesus macaques represents a paradigm shift from more conventional practices.",Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups,10090122,R24OD030035,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Breeding', 'Case Study', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Ovulation', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primates', 'Progesterone', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'affiliative behavior', 'animal resource', 'behavior observation', 'cohesion', 'feeding', 'fighting', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'network models', 'pregnant', 'reproductive', 'season of birth', 'social', 'social attachment', 'social relationships', 'social unrest', 'wound']",OD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2021,802738
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,10199050,R01LM012974,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Semantics', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'behavior change', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'digital', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'network models', 'nicotine patch', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'supervised learning', 'virtual coach']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,343235
"Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media 2/12/2019 ProjectSummary - Google Docs Project Summary I will leverage social media conversations, specifically Reddit, to examine treatment help-seeking at an unprecedented scale, thereby collecting evidence “in the wild” as a new strategy to monitor and respond to the opioid crisis through the following aims. Aim 1. Data Driven Characterization of Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users: I will systematically identify Reddit posts about opioids, identify if the post is help-seeking for treatment, and contextualize the content of help-seeking posts. Aim 2. Data Driven Characterization of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to understand how peers organically respond to help-seeking for treatment by building data-driven models to discern what attributes of posts are predictive of receiving a response from a peer and to examine the typical content and reciprocity of responses. Aim 3. Assess the Quality of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to identify the types of treatment, treatment services, and treatment referral services that are provided in the responses and assess the quality of lay responses to opioid treatment help-seeking. Currently, little is known about how drug users engage social media to support or combat their addictions. Reddit is the sixth most popular website in the US with many reporters noting that it may be the last lifeline for opioid users. Yet, little has been done to tap this potential source for social media monitoring, especially given the difficulty of finding self-identified opioid users who are already contemplating strategies to treat their addiction. This study adds a new significant perspective to social media monitoring and will be among the first in public health to consider social media conversation threads by assessing unique posts about opioid help-seeking, the responses these posts get, and the quality of responses to addiction help-seeking, thereby creating a knowledge base for public health leaders to respond. Success of these aims will generate a number of future research directions that will support interventions that address the needs of self-identified opioid users seeking help on Reddit. Moreover, within all three aims this study will bring significant methodological advances to the study of social media around substance use with the aims relying heavily on automated approaches and analysis first developed in the computational sciences engendering more data scientists to join public health to create actionable knowledge. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4XHd63xhPZT8OFf9bHQ2q6XHpYp_c4AbouAOtAC3SU/edit 1/1 2/12/2019 ProjectNarrative - Google Docs Project Narrative An explosion of surveillance tools fueled by big media data (including social media) is changing public health. These data reveal what a person is thinking/doing and when they are thinking/doing it based on the content and timing of their public posts, providing an assessment of organic help-seeking for addiction and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing that was never before possible. I will extract actionable intelligence from social media data, specifically Reddit, to support more agile, responsive opioid intervention research by studying (a) treatment help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, (b) lay responses to help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, and (c) whether lay peers link self-identified opioid users to evidence-based treatment, treatment services, or treatment referral services. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyIXTdDAbFSkCe81q6hThDiZzKGCXkCy8npWgzr5wfM/edit 1/1",Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media,10137210,K25DA049944,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Code', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Drug user', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Hotlines', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Social intelligence', 'Source', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'combat', 'dissemination trial', 'evidence base', 'help-seeking behavior', 'illicit opioid', 'knowledge base', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'peer', 'phrases', 'posters', 'prescription opioid', 'public health intervention', 'referral services', 'research study', 'response', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K25,2021,189498
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,10120523,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'age group', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'movie', 'neglect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive mood', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social neuroscience', 'young adult']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,584996
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,10089147,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,664089
"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games. This work will address for the first time how these important neuromodulators encode social processes important for healthy cognition and affected by disease and injury.",Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans,10227238,R01MH124115,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Catecholamines', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Essential Tremor', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Serotonergic System', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Perception', 'Social Processes', 'System', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'dopamine system', 'human model', 'implantation', 'information processing', 'mental state', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social norm', 'social relationships']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,996439
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain CircuitsPD Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology).

"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries.

"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,10164858,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital healthcare', 'experience', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'remote monitoring', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,649383
"A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare Project Summary Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to non-communicable disease worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease. The current standards of care suffer from subjectivity, inconsistent delivery, and limited access with growing waitlists. New informatics solutions, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) that can port to more ubiquitous mobile health devices and that are not restricted for use in clinical settings, have great potential to complement or even replace aspects of the standards of care. We propose to develop a novel informatics solution for one of the most pressing mental health burdens, autism, which is up in incidence by more than 600% since 1990, among the fastest growing pediatric concerns today, and highly representative of many other neuropsychiatric conditions. We have invented a prototype mobile system called Guess What (guesswhat.stanford.edu) (GW) that turns the focus of the camera on the child through a fluid social engagement with his/her social partner that reinforces prosocial learning while simultaneously measuring the child’s developmental learning progress. At its simplest level, the GW app challenges the child to imitate social and emotion-centric prompts shown on the screen of a smartphone held just above the eyes of the individual with whom the child is playing. But more, as a home-based repeat-use system, GW uses computer vision algorithms and emotion classifiers integrated into gameplay to detect emotion in the child’s face via the phone’s front camera, automatically finding agreement with the displayed prompt, while capturing features such as gaze, eye contact, and joint attention. Preliminary work with more than 20 autistic children resulted in positive user feedback, evidence of high engagement for both the parents and children, and importantly, evidence of clinically meaningful gains in socialization. A single session produces 90 seconds of enriched social video and sensor data, opening up an exciting opportunity for the game play itself to passively generate labeled computer vision libraries that enable the development of better models with higher diagnostic precision going forward. Our proposed project will show that GW can (a.) serve as a mobile therapy that can be used repeatedly by families to target core deficits of autism while inherently tracking progress during use, and, (b.) serve as a distributed system to crowdsource the acquisition of new labeled image libraries for AI models that can automatically classify diagnostic features relevant to autism and extend to other sectors of mental health (and even beyond). Project Narrative Mental health, which accounts for a significant percentage of the global health burden, can be effectively managed through mobile and digital tools, yet suffers from limited access, inconsistent treatments, and qualitative approaches that do not scale. Taking aim at an increasingly pervasive and canonical mental health problem, autism, we plan to build a game-based solution that can treat (addressing issues social interaction, eye contact, and social-emotional awareness, among other things) while tracking progress, and that can automatically generate computer vision libraries for deep learning models that permit enhanced diagnostic feature extraction in the future.",A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare,10122795,R01LM013364,"['8 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Anger', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Distributed Systems', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Forehead', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'computer generated', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'feasibility testing', 'feature extraction', 'gaze', 'global health', 'image archival system', 'innovation', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'mHealth', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized health care', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sensor', 'social', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'social reciprocity', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,667434
"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,10167665,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Job loss', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'social observations', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,332121
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,10150095,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,660945
"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram. This will be accomplished using an innovative methodology involving advanced machine learning, statistical, geospatial and network analysis.",Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution,10142413,R21DA050689,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communications Media', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vendor', 'Youth', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient advocacy group', 'peer influence', 'prescription drug abuse', 'response', 'service providers', 'social media', 'study population', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,197344
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9841303,R01DC014498,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317844
"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,10162664,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2021,428695
"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools.

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.  The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression. Use of computational modeling will enable identification of neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with greater treatment response, and may guide future personalization of psychotherapy.",Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression,10191051,K23MH123864,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'geriatric depression', 'geriatric major depression', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'middle age', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'psychoeducation', 'random forest', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'skills', 'social', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,191063
"Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships Project Summary Infants communicate to their caregivers that they need food by crying. This represents our very first social interaction that lays the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing a strong social bond with caregivers. Infants that cannot regulate their nutrition are at risk for malnourishment or obesity, whose deleterious effects will negatively impact the wellness of these individuals for their lifetime. Abnormalities in social recognition and communication, like those found in autism spectrum disorders, also become apparent during infancy. Despite the critical importance of infants communicating nutritional need to caregivers, the neuronal basis remains unknown. To address this deficit, I propose to study social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing. Tadpoles use this begging display to encode nutritional state, enabling us to quantify hunger- based communication. These tadpoles are translucent, allowing us to visualize the development and activity of neurons in the brain. I am combining this novel model system and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to interrogate the neuronal substrates of hunger-based communication. I will examine whether nutritional quality influences the development of neurons that regulating feeding and communication with in vivo brain imaging. I will also test for a functional role of these neuronal cell-types in begging behavior using a high throughput behavior assay, whole brain clearing and immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific manipulations of neuronal activity. As social recognition is important for establishing parent-offspring bonds, I will then use in vivo neural activity imaging to determine how tadpoles recognize their parents using multi-modal sensory integration. Completion of these experiments will transform our understanding of a social behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing. There is a pressing need for this research because there are currently no established models for studying the neural mechanisms of infant communication of hunger. This work is important to public health because some of the most prevalent disorders afflicting children in the United States are eating related disorders and conditions involving abnormalities in social recognition and communication, such as autism spectrum disorders. More research on infant feeding and communication is needed to better understand these pathologies in the youngest members of our society. Narrative Communication of nutritional need during infancy is our very first social interaction, laying the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing strong social bonds with caregivers. The proposed work uses a unique biological model – social tadpoles that communicate nutritional need to their caregivers – to uncover how infants evaluate their nutritional state, recognize their caregivers, and communicate that they need food. These studies have implications for informing preventative strategies and treatments for childhood obesity and autism spectrum disorders, two of the most prevalent diseases afflicting the youngest members of our society.",Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships,10263607,DP2HD102042,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Critical Thinking', 'Crying', 'Dancing', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Eating', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Life', 'Methodology', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Study models', 'Tadpoles', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'member', 'multimodality', 'neurogenetics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity in children', 'offspring', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social attachment', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,86547
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743
"An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support ABSTRACT Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes, clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources. We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in 44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006- 2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR- SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis, informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2). We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR- based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support- cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities. NARRATIVE Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes and is critical to racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. This study will develop and validate an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) in 44,348 women diagnosed with BC from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Developing this measure is central to identifying patients at risk of low social support and to enhancing social support-cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities.",An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support,10245056,R01CA253028,"['Academy', 'Address', 'African American', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'California', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Social Conditions', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Text', 'Treatment outcome', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer health disparity', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'hazard', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'hormone therapy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'patient response', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'social', 'social computing', 'social health determinants', 'social relationships', 'social structure', 'structured data', 'theories', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,615036
"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10167793,K99MH124435,"['Affect', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'mind control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'recruit', 'redshift', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'social competition', 'social deficits', 'social interventions', 'social neuroscience', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,123390
"Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder Project Summary Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms, combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically, we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD, using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions, providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient- psychotherapist interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both borderline and avoidant personality disorders are marked by profound impairments in interpersonal functioning. However, the brain mechanisms underlying these social deficits are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better elucidate how the brain is involved in complex social interactions and the clinical relevance of these processes for personality disorders.","Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder",10234509,R01MH123069,"['Assertiveness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer framework', 'geometric structure', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,648979
"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics. The outcome of the work will inform how emotions should be conceptualized within a broader research framework of mental health domains.",Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation,10227196,R01MH124112,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'data repository', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'movie', 'negative affect', 'neural network architecture', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,774017
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms Mediating TMS and Oxytocin Effects on Social Cognition We are requesting an increase in the yearly direct costs to support the aims of the MERIT renewal. What we propose is a dramatic leap into the future of social neuroscience and lies at the bleeding edge of current technology. The proposed research is innovative, ambitious, and necessary for understanding how primate, and by extension human, brains enable appropriate social behavior in the real world. Our proposal advances understanding of how primate brains generate appropriate social behavior through a tightly-integrated, ambitious set of 4 specific aims combining simultaneous wireless neurophysiological recordings in multiple freely-moving monkeys interacting naturally in varied social contexts, semi-to-fully-automated quantification of social behavior using computer vision, pharmacological manipulations, and reversible perturbations of neural activity. To our knowledge, none of these experiments has ever been attempted in macaques.
