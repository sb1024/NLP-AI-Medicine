"Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury Abstract  Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.  Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry. Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Meniscus injuries are very common and frequently lead to early onset osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability. This project will identify biomechanical and biological predictors of cartilage degeneration after meniscus injury and partial meniscectomy. Our findings will be utilized to improve care and outcomes for patients suffering from meniscus injuries.",Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury,10230722,R01AR079184,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cadaver', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dinoprostone', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medial meniscus structure', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'cartilage degradation', 'clinical phenotype', 'demographics', 'disability', 'early onset', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'joint destruction', 'joint inflammation', 'joint injury', 'macrophage', 'meniscus injury', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'random forest', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treadmill']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,696513
"Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Project Summary / Abstract  Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy with cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) often leading to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for medically intractable focal onset seizures (FOS), this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) is a feasible strategy to treat LGS. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) acquire preliminary evidence for safety and efficacy in treating GOS of LGS with RNS-TCN; (2) create an interactive therapy-decision support system based on patient-specific computational network models and machine learning to identify optimal lead placement and stimulation parameters.  Using the RNSÂ® System, which is FDA approved for FOS, an early feasibility IDE study will be conducted at 6 epilepsy centers in 20 patients with LGS and medically intractable GOS. The patients will be enrolled in two cohorts of 10, with safety and efficacy milestones in the first cohort governing the enrollment of the second cohort. Patients will have two depth leads placed bilaterally in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and two subdural strip leads placed bilaterally on the medial prefrontal cortex. These targets are selected because they are implicated in the onset and spread of GOS in LGS. Leads will be located within each target such that stimulation maximally engages the thalamocortical network, guided by finite-element biophysical models created from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The finite-element biophysical models will also be used to identify the initial RNS-TCN stimulation pathway and current amplitude. During the blinded evaluation period patients will be randomized to receive either high-frequency short burst (HFSB) or low-frequency long burst (LFLB) RNS-TCN, then enter a washout period before crossing over to receive the other treatment condition. During the open label period stimulation parameters can be modified at the discretion of the physician. Parameter adjustments will be informed by using a Bayesian optimization model developed for specifically for each patient. All clinical and electrophysiological data collected during the study will be used to identify a biomarker of clinical response; if found, these will aid future epilepsy research and clinical practice. If safety is favorable and there is preliminary evidence for efficacy, then this early experience will inform the design of a future larger feasibility study.  In addition to treating a population in need, this project engages in fundamental discovery of biomarkers in generalized network epilepsies, and develops novel automated therapy selection policies that have the potential to improve the lives of patients with LGS and other seizure disorders. Project Narrative Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy characterized by cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) that often lead to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for treating medically intractable focal onset seizures, this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation can also be used to treat LGS. The intent of the proposed research is to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) involved in GOS, to identify promising detection and stimulation approaches, and to characterize neurophysiological biomarkers of clinical efficacy that will aid future research and clinical practice.",Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome,9958791,UH3NS109557,"['12 year old', 'Adverse effects', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Centromedian Thalamic Nucleus', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clonic Seizure', 'Computer Models', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gastaut syndrome', 'Generalized Epilepsy', 'Genetic Crossing Over', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Implant', 'Injury', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lead', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tonic Seizures', 'Update', 'addiction', 'atonic seizure', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biophysical model', 'blind', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational network modeling', 'design', 'diaries', 'early experience', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'interactive therapy', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open label', 'potential biomarker', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'response', 'safety testing', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEUROPACE, INC.",UH3,2021,831388
"Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Summary Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However, improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error. In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1ï²) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire patient cohort up to 24 months. Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication. Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Narrative Caused by a variety of etiologies, acute and chronic renal allograft injury often results in the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), is a significant cause of allograft failure and poor outcomes; the reference standard for which is tissue biopsy, which is limited due to sampling error and risk of complications. In this proposal, we will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1ï²) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis, taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy. We will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning, prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.",Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach,10279690,R01DK129888,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Allografting', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histopathology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lesion', 'Living Donors', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical encounter', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interstitial', 'kidney allograft', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'renal damage', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,625886
"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an âadequateâ seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. The proposed studies target characteristics of therapeutic seizures elicited during ECT (seizure duration, stimulation dose) and their relationship to pre-treatment and post-treatment neurobiology measured with pre- existing MRI datasets.",Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression,10069399,R03MH121769,"['Ache', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disorientation', 'Dose', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Muscle relaxants', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'interpatient variability', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'motor symptom', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'sex', 'side effect', 'social stigma', 'vector']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,79417
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of âbig dataâ has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,10101640,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug repurposing', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'risk stratification', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,531246
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,10310774,UH3NS103550,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'live stream', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,109980
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStreamÂ®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEASÂ®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure.

It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStreamÂ®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEASÂ®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",10336135,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,100000
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biology', 'CREB1 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576
"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Menarche', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Placebos', 'Policies', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'arm', 'base', 'birth control', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness analysis', 'efficacy clinical trial', 'glucosylceramidase', 'health care disparity', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'oncology trial', 'patient population', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'unethical']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,10129277,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,798304
"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of Â³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP â¥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) â an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patientâs age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patientsâ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP â¥130/80 mm Hg (from â¥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,10111556,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Side Effects', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'provider adherence', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,121124
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patientâs health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a âtrial and errorâ fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions.

"Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors Project Summary Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field. Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations. Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response. Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations. Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19. Project Narrative We will develop deep learning-based models to predict the TCR binding specificity of neoantigens/MHC complexes (immunogenicity). We will predict patient response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on immunogenicity and other properties of neoantigens. We will build a comprehensive neoantigen webserver, which will facilitate a coordinated effort to accelerate tumor immunogenomics research and clinical applications for personalized medicine.",Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors,10180781,R01CA258584,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MHC antigen', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'data sharing networks', 'deep learning', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vaccine development', 'web portal']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,378897
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment â before treatment â to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University including the integration of machine learning to derive a âPOET Scoreâ â a personalized quantitative efficacy score â based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy Project Summary The WHO approved 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) has been found non-inferior to 6H in preventing TB reactivation and achieves higher completion rates. The National TB program in Uganda is currently transitioning from 6HP to 3HP which will be scaled up starting in Jan 2021. Rifapentine has not been widely used in Uganda outside clinical trials and therefore its safety profile in programmatic setting in adults and children is still uncertain. Accurate profiling of patients likely to experience 3HP related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has the potential to improve TPT completion rates, and in turn improve TB control. Our proposal seeks to describe safety profiles of 3HP, completion rates and the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of 3HP-related ADRs for people receiving TPT at programmatic level. This study will take place in five health facilities in Uganda in collaboration with the National TB program and the National Drug Authority. We will conduct a cohort study where 614 adults and children >2 years, who have been initiated on 3HP for TPT by the facility clinician according to standard of care will be enrolled. Participants will be both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected. Participants will be followed up monthly for evaluation for ADRs using a standardized questionnaires, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function testing). For a subset of 300 patients (150 cases who develop grade 2 and above ADRs and 150 controls who do not experience ADRs), we will conduct pharmacokinetic sampling to measure rifapentine and isoniazid concentrations and selected genotyping (for examples N-Acetyl Transferase, Cytochrome 2E1) and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. We will use pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic-pharmacodynamic models and stochastic gradient boosted machine learning together with conventional statistical methods to determine factors associated with ADRs and simple prediction rules for the identification of patients at high risk for ADR. We will also determine the effect of the ADRs on TPT completion rates. Patients will subsequently be followed up for up to 3 years and assessed for TB reactivation according to standard of care to determine the incidence of TB reactivation in patients who have received 3HP and the risk factors for this. This study will provide data on the safety of 3HP during national roll-out and provide information on who is likely to develop ADRs which can affect treatment completion and therefore may benefit from alternative regimens. Study Narrative: This project will describe the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of adverse drug reactions among people receiving 3HP for TPT in Uganda. The results of this study will inform clinical decisions for identifying patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions related to 3HP in the African setting.",Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy,10217331,R01AI160434,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Cytochromes', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health care facility', 'Hypotension', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interruption', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transferase', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Vision', 'World Health Organization', 'adverse drug reaction', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'authority', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'flu', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human leukocyte antigen testing', 'improved', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'pharmacodynamic model', 'prevent', 'programs', 'reactivation from latency', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'rifapentine', 'scale up', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'uptake']",NIAID,INFECTIOUS DISEASES INSTITUTE,R01,2021,138370
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9869948,UH3NS103550,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Scalp structure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'algorithm development', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'live stream', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'patient population', 'response', 'support tools', 'targeted biomarker', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,1367977
"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,10164627,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,373803
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,10112878,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,696730
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.âs Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment. Oncospace has licensed three patents and subscription to complete patient treatment records for over 6,000 radiation oncology patients from JHU. The company has won the Microsoft Innovation Acceleration Award for its innovative platform to deliver AI-enabled healthcare solutions to the radiation oncology community. Page 1 of 1 Narrative During standard-of-care radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, the salivary glands often sustain radiation- induced injury leading to xerostomia (dry mouth). Machine learning-based predictions can be used to help create treatment plans that minimize the chance of severe xerostomia, and to better anticipate and manage its occurrence.

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncusâ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,10065497,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effective treatment', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'efficacy outcomes', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'pulmonary function', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,236163
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., âdegradomeâ). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,10170180,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,600979
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. IN particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 26,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,500 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders,10064583,R01MH116270,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clozapine', 'Code', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'personalized intervention', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,421250
"Sex-Specific Functional Connectivity Changes in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to develop sex-specific resting state fMRI biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD) and to determine their underlying genetic correlates. Our primary aim is to determine the locations and the degree of sex-specific functional connectivity differences associated with MDD patients as compared to healthy subjects, and to test whether those sex-specific connectivity differences define sex-specific subtypes of MDD. The benefit of achieving these goals will be twofold: (1) in the clinic, achieving these goals will allow for more accurate diagnostic and treatment-response predictive algorithms for MDD, to reduce time to remission in MDD patients. (2) In the laboratory, our work will guide discovery of novel sex-specific circuit mechanisms and treatments for MDD. Our second aim is to determine if sex-specific MDD effects on connectivity can be predicted by regional gene expression in the brain. Investigating the relationship between brain gene expression and MDD effects on functional connectivity would implicate novel genes in the circuit mechanism of MDD and identify genes that interact with sex in driving MDD symptomatology. To achieve these aims, we will use parametric and non-parametric statistical testing to define sex-specific functional connectivity differences between depressed and healthy men, and between depressed and healthy women. Secondary analyses will test whether sex-specific classifiers for differentiating MDD subjects and healthy controls (âdiagnostic biomarkersâ) outperform classifiers trained on all subjects independent of sex. To identify genetic correlates of sex-specific MDD effects on functional connectivity, we will use the multivariate technique of partial least squares regression to locate linear combinations of genes which can predict MDD-related connectivity differences in males and in females. Finally, to identify sex-specific subtypes of MDD, we will use a combination of regularized canonical correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering in a validated method for subtype discovery previously published in Dr. Conor Listonâs lab. This project will fill a substantial gap in our knowledge of sex differences in MDD functional connectivity and the underlying genetic correlates of those differences. This project will also involve the execution of a concrete training plan to allow me to develop concrete technical skills in fMRI analysis and machine learning techniques, conceptual skill in hypothesis testing, data interpretation, and scientific communication, and clinical competency as a licensed physician, all under the guidance and mentorship of the projectâs sponsor Dr. Liston and co-sponsor Dr. Francis Lee, who are both accomplished physician-scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been cited as the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting up to 14.2 million patients in the United States per year, and contributing to over 47,000 suicides per year. Most patients experience a delay in reaching remission due to a lack of precise treatment selection methods. Our goal is to apply a biomarker-driven approach of precision medicine in psychiatry, using machine learning tools to analyze human neuroimaging and genetic data, with the clinical endpoint of shortened time to remission for MDD patients.",Sex-Specific Functional Connectivity Changes in Major Depressive Disorder,10235389,F30MH124317,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Syndrome', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnostics', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'comorbidity', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'guided inquiry', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'regional difference', 'risk variant', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skills', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F30,2021,48868
"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286
"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders,10074155,R01MH116269,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clozapine', 'Code', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'personalized intervention', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,425000
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (â¥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (â¥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083
"Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence- based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD. Project Narrative Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD adherence, and prevent relapse.

"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogrenâs syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify âclustersâ of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments. The proposed studies will bring together clinical, laboratory and statistical collaborators to address these knowledge gaps.",Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease,10146301,R01CA118953,"['Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complication', 'Consensus', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Disease Management', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enrollment', 'Fibroblasts', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homologous Transplantation', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lichen Planus', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory Disease', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Steroids', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systemic disease', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'chemokine', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'disorder subtype', 'early detection biomarkers', 'financial toxicity', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'therapeutic target', 'translational scientist', 'transplant survivor', 'treatment duration', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,202856
"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators. Our research will thereby provide new insights into disease, and well enable the more effective targeting of therapy to those who will most benefit at the appropriate time.",Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder,10238767,R01MH122569,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Far East', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'long short term memory', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'psychogenetics', 'public health priorities', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,667757
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTNânamely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratoryâs advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model', 'virtual patient']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2021,101117
"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQâs mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083
"Integrating genomic and clinical data to predict disease phenotypes using heterogeneous ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic and other âomicâ profiles hold immense potential for advancing personalize/precision medicine by enabling the accurate prediction of disease phenotypes or outcomes for individual patients, which can be used by a clinician to design an appropriate plan of care. However, despite this potential, the actual impact of these omic profiles on disease phenotype prediction may be limited by the fact that even large cohorts collecting these data do not cover large enough numbers of individuals. In contrast, a variety of clinical data types, such as laboratory tests and physician notes, are routinely collected and studied for a much larger number of patients undergoing treatment for such diseases at medical centers. The abundance of these clinical data, and their complementarity with multi-omic data, offer an opportunity to advance personalized medicine by integrating these disparate types of data. However, this disparity in data formats, namely several omic profiles being structured, and several clinical data types, such as physician notes, being unstructured, poses challenges for this integration. An associated challenge due to this disparity is that different classes of computational methods are likely to be the most effective for predicting disease phenotypes from these clinical and omics datasets. These challenges pose barriers for current data integration methods to address this problem. Here, we propose an innovative approach to this integration by assimilating diverse base phenotype predictors inferred from individual clinical and omics datasets into heterogeneous ensembles. These ensembles, which have shown promise for several other computational genomics problems, can aggregate an unrestricted number and variety of base predictors, which is ideal for this integration problem. Specifically, we describe how existing heterogeneous ensemble methods for single datasets can be transformed and advanced to address the multiple clinical and omic dataset integration problem. In particular, we detail novel algorithms for improving these integrative ensembles by modeling and incorporating the inherent patient and dataset heterogeneity in these datasets. We also propose novel algorithms for leveraging the inherent complementarity among clinical and omic datasets, as well as an innovative approach for handling expected missing data, both with the goal of making ensemble phenotype predictors more accurate and applicable to patient cohorts. To assess the performance of this novel suite of data integration-oriented heterogeneous ensembles, we will validate their effectiveness for predicting asthma and Inflammatory Bowel Disease phenotypes in substantial patient cohorts with diverse omics and clinical datasets. We will publicly release efficient software implementations of the methods developed in this project to enable others to carry out similar analyses with other diverse data collections. Successful accomplishment of the proposed work will contribute to the advancement of personalized medicine through accurate individualized prediction of disease phenotypes. Predictive modeling is expected to become a cornerstone on the path to achieving precision/personalized medicine, as one of the key tasks here will be making individualized predictions of disease characteristics/phenotypes like subtype and risk of progression and/or recurrence. We propose several innovative computational algorithms for developing accurate predictive models that integrate diverse clinical and omic data, as well as several rigorous validation exercises that will demonstrate the capabilities of these models.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract â Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Mycobacterium tuberculosis aerobiology and novel tools to assess infectiousness Tuberculosis (TB), the leading cause of death in people living with HIV, is the archetypal airborne disease, spread person-to-person through the inhalation of aerosolized bacilli. In endemic regions, most TB disease results from recently acquired infection with M. tuberculosis (Mtb), and studies support that a minority of individuals are responsible for most TB transmission events. Although focusing TB control interventions, such as TB preventive treatment (TPT), on contacts of these highly infectious individuals is cost-effective, tests that accurately determine the infectiousness of patients with TB are lacking. The overall objective of this proposal is to prevent TB-related morbidity and mortality among PLHIV by developing a novel cough-based diagnostic of TB infectiousness. We previously developed a research tool to measure Mtb cough aerosolization, the cough aerosol sampling system (CASS), that predicts TB infectiousness. Recently, we investigated cough frequency as a marker of TB infectiousness, identified unique TB-related cough signatures and developed a mobile privacy-preserving cough detection system. In the proposed study, we will enroll HIV-positive and HIV-negative Kenyan adults who are newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB to assess their level of TB infectiousness using CASS-measured aerosolized Mtb counts (the outcome). In Aim 1, we will investigate cough frequency and/or cough spectrogram (collectively âcough signatureâ) to estimate TB infectiousness and investigate the impact of HIV co-infection on TB infectiousness. In Aim 2, we will identify the household contacts of Aim 1 participants (index cases) to investigate for latent TB infection using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and determine whether index case cough signatures associated with high Mtb aerosol counts are associated with a greater frequency of positive IGRAs in household contacts. Additionally, at 6 months after enrollment we will re-test household contacts with IGRAs to understand if the durability of positive responses is associated with index case cough signatures. We hypothesize that individuals with high Mtb aerosol counts will have high cough frequencies and unique cough spectrograms, and that cough spectrograms will differ by HIV status despite similar Mtb aerosol counts. Furthermore, we hypothesize that household contacts to index cases with âhighly infectiousâ cough signatures are more likely to have positive IGRAs at baseline and at 6-month follow- up. Our team has developed the tools to not only robustly determine infectiousness (CASS), but to evaluate both cough frequency and intensity (spectrogram analyses) in a high HIV/TB burden setting. By identifying cough signatures predictive of TB infectiousness, we will develop tools for clinicians and public health programs to support the targeting of TB control interventions. Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) stops infection with M. tuberculosis from progressing to tuberculosis disease and is key to the control of tuberculosis, the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. Identifying people who are spreading the most tuberculosis (i.e., most infectious) would enable the targeting of TPT and other interventions to control tuberculosis. The investigators will use aerobiology assessments of infectiousness to study whether cough signatures identify highly infectious individuals with TB and to investigate the effects of HIV infection on tuberculosis infectiousness.",Mycobacterium tuberculosis aerobiology and novel tools to assess infectiousness,10151102,UH2AI152621,"['Acid Fast Bacillae Staining Method', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Bacillus', 'Belief', 'Biological Assay', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Contact Tracing', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Immunocompetence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inhalation', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kenya', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sputum', 'Study models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'co-infection', 'cost effective', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UH2,2021,205391
"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposalâs objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,10113626,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,397484
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,10159844,R01AI152158,"['5 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'microchip', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pediatrician', 'point of care', 'point-of-care detection', 'point-of-care diagnosis', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,960557
"Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), continues to be a severe global health problem. TB is multifaceted, but a central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mtb to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents with potent growth inhibitory activity. This persistence in the face of immunologic and antibiotic pressure underlies several important facets of TB disease, including 1) the existence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and, in the setting of immunologic failure of LTBI control, its role in the genesis of active TB and 2) the prolonged course of TB antibiotic therapy, which requires 6 months of multidrug therapy to achieve reliable clinical cure. Rather than producing complete bacterial eradication in all treated subjects, cure following TB chemotherapy is now understood to be an antibiotic induced paucibacillary state in which prevention of relapse depends in part on poorly understood host factors. The host and bacterial determinants that mediate these two interrelated types of persistence are only partially understood, a knowledge gap the Tri-I-TBRU aims to fill. We propose a set of 3 intersecting projects and 3 cores all focused on different facets of the problem of paucibacillary TB, both post treatment and LTBI. The projects will use samples and clinical data from TB cohorts at our clinical site at GHESKIO in Port Au Prince Haiti, to examine the immunologic, microbiomic, transcriptomic, pharmacokinetic, and genetic factors that influence or predict the transition points between paucibacillary states of TB disease and active transmissible infection. These human studies will be compared and contrasted with a new mouse model of paucibacillary infection that will allow us to test mechanistic hypotheses about the host and bacterial determinants of paucibacillary disease. This work with be conducted by a team of highly collaborative investigators who have who have worked well together for several years. Tuberculosis is a major global health burden, killing more than 1.5 million people every year, despite the availability of therapy. A central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents. This project will investigate the host and bacterial determinants that mediate persistence of Mtb within its human host.","Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection",10268801,U19AI162568,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Bacillus', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Fluids', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Country', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haiti', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Ships', 'Siblings', 'Sterilization', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'chronic infection', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'immunopathology', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'mouse model', 'next generation sequencing', 'pathogen', 'pressure', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis chemotherapy', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U19,2021,2755450
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity â 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Americas', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibody Response', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Arizona', 'Aspergillosis', 'Biological Assay', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Histoplasmosis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Outcome', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis', 'Patients', 'Primary Infection', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'desert fever', 'disabling symptom', 'fungus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment response']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ï¬ndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efï¬cacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efï¬ciency of RCT ï¬ndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efï¬cient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiï¬ed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'esophageal cancer patient', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalatedâ, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,10114984,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1
"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require âescalationâ, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program âOptimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasisâconstitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC âOptimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasisâ will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Childhood âOmicsâ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood âOmicsâ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,10147861,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker signature', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1490544
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,10190807,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'sample archive', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,191195
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,169560
"Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation Project summary Computational multi-scale modeling is a growing area of research that aims to link whole slide images and radiographic iamges with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Multi-scale modeling has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. Current applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. No actionable information can be gained from multi-scale biomarkers yet. We propose to develop a multi-scale modeling framework to support treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation for patients with brain tumors, focusing on the most aggressive subtype of glioma, IDH wild-type high grade glioma. In Aim 1, we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate multi-scale data for treatment response. We will use our expertise in data fusion and develop novel approaches to integrate multi- scale data to predict first line treatment response. In Aim 2, we will develop algorithms that allow combining multi-scale data at diagnosis with multi-modal MR imaging data during treatment follow-up. We will focus on predicting treatment response and progression and whether we can predict these events earlier than radiologists can. In Aim 3, we will develop algorithms that use the multi-scale data to predict drug target activities and also suggest novel drugs for patients that become resistant to first line treatment. We will use a mixture of publicly available glioma multi-scale data sets totaling more than 1000 patients, and also 1600 retrospective and 150 prospective brain tumor patients from Stanford Medical Center. Combining these complementary data sources in a multi-scale framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop multi-scale signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to brain tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict treatment response. Readily, because whole slide images and radiographic imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of brain tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable multi-scale signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to clinical applications is feasible, including optimizing recruitment for clinical trials. Narrative We propose a multi-scale framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for brain tumor patients. We will develop algorithms integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of multi-scale biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, suggest the use of novel drugs and help during treatment monitoring.","Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation",10184938,R01CA260271,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Link', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data fusion', 'digital pathology', 'epigenetic silencing', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'methylation pattern', 'molecular imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'multiscale data', 'mutational status', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'pathology imaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'temozolomide', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612041
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique âmodel systemâ of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection,10128898,R21AI151491,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Allografting', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Epidemiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Steroid Resistance', 'Steroids', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker identification', 'cell behavior', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'graft function', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'kidney allograft', 'migration', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,266691
"Deep learning for renal tumor characterization Our long-term objective is to develop deep learning techniques capable of predicting characteristics and treatment response or response to surveillance to assist clinical decision- making in renal tumors that are potential candidates for ablation therapy, biopsy, active surveillance or surgical resection. An increasing number of renal tumors are being diagnosed, due in part to incidental detection from the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although partial nephrectomy is still considered the primary treatment for small renal masses, percutaneous ablation is increasingly performed as a therapeutic, nephron-sparing approach. One challenge for interventional radiologists and urologists who manage these patients is selection for therapy, since the average rate of progression is slow for small renal tumors and metastasis rarely occurs. A technique that could distinguish indolent tumors from those will progress based on data from the imaging methods used to detect and delineate renal masses would enable early triage to observation versus invasive treatment. Deep learning, a type of machine learning technique which takes raw images as input, and applies many layers of transformations to calculate an output signal, has already led to breakthroughs in other areas of image recognition, and is increasingly used for medical image analysis. However, its application in the field of interventional radiology is currently limited. Furthermore, no study in the literature has applied deep learning to kidney lesion segmentation and characteristics/outcome prediction. In this project, we propose to develop novel deep learning architectures based on routine MR imaging that allow for accurate renal mass segmentation and prediction of characteristics and outcome in renal tumors. Using data from four independent cohorts, we will use our deep learning architectures to predict (1) benign versus malignant histology (2) growth rate in stage 1a renal cell carcinoma (3) SSIGN score in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and (4) clinical endpoints. We will integrate segmentation and classification into one net that suitable for clinical application. In addition, we will compare results with those of experts and traditional machine learning approaches. The inability to determine aggressiveness of renal tumors based on pretreatment imaging makes it challenging for urologists or interventional radiologists to select appropriate patients for active surveillance versus therapy with nephrectomy or ablation. Our research project uses deep learning to distinguish renal mass from normal tissue and predict characteristics, treatment response or response to surveillance in renal tumors. By using a multi-institutional patient cohort and conventional MR imaging sequences, we will demonstrate the generalizability and broad applicability of our algorithm. Our models have the potential to help guide clinical management of patients with renal tumors.",Deep learning for renal tumor characterization,10116348,R03CA249554,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dropout', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Kidney', 'Modeling', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrons', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal Mass', 'Research Project Grants', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Urologist', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'random forest', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R03,2021,80500
"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This âtrimodality therapyâ is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Adjuvant', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Extranodal', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck Dissection', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'capsule', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer care', 'phase II trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk minimization', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,168240
"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patientâs brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidateâs long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027
"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XRÂ®), (c) Varenicline (ChantixÂ®), and (d) HORIZANTÂ® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders.

"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,173784
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers â livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our groupâs expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers â livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10208791,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,84562
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,10149283,R01DE028741,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Economics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral Stage', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analysis pipeline', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'international center', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,380042
"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individualâs treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, âThe Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illnessâ), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12â14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify â¥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not.

"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,10196980,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'feature selection', 'global health', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,245551
"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on â¥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less âRA-likeâ than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more âopportunityâ to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMSâ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management. In this proposal, we will define the poorly understood subgroup of RA patients where multiple therapies have been ineffective, enabling future studies to expand our understanding of inflammatory arthritis, and to inform discovery of novel treatment targets.",Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis,10301407,R21AR078339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk-Taking', 'Spondylarthropathies', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'joint inflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'patient screening', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'risk variant', 'small molecule', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,251507
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a âtop-downâ (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary âbottom-upâ (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patientsâ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patientsâ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The projectâs innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI toolsâ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,10300427,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'efficacious treatment', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2021,33247
"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNFï¡ therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNFï¡ therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNFï¡ therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNFï¡ responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNFï¡ responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNFï¡ therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNFï¡ therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNFï¡ treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'acute infection', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'dosage', 'gastrointestinal system', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multilayer perceptron', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R43,2021,251371
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",10129958,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350335
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or âbullseye rashâ, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donorâs circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patientsâ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Maintenance', 'Methadone', 'Monitor', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'methadone treatment', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'supervised learning', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10149998,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'former smoker', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2021,185497
"Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning Project Summary This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimerâs Disease-Related Dementias, differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson (expert in advanced statistics). The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce- Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2) use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stagesâreducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Narrative The development and validation of predictive models is a critical step toward improving strategies for an early diagnosis of sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other neurodegenerative diseases and improving strategies for personalized treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel imaging genetic biomarkers that can help clinicians with an early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sporadic FTD.

"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped âpan-Omicsâ data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10299634,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10206138,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,657625
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression.

"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'remote monitoring', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146
"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technologyâs transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and Î²- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrientsâ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytesâ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technologyâ equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilitiesâthat can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individualsâ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision nutrition', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (âbig dataâ) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinsonâs Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinsonâs Disease,10149422,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&apos', 's Disease Rating Scale', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352779
"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someoneâs risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10339079,R43DA051279,"['Accidents', 'American', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Data', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency response', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Municipalities', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Workplace', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'novel strategies', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'recidivism', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma Project Summary There is currently no diagnostic tool to accurately predict pediatric neuroblastoma disease outcome that is based on the mechanistic nature of the disease and genomic information of a childâs tumor. Neuroblastoma is a solid, cancerous tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that accounts for half of all cancers in infants younger than 1 year. Uncertainties in the trajectory of disease progression has led to aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments that often result in long-term developmental disabilities for children. Determination of the critical drivers of neuroblastoma initiation and assessment of their interactions for an individual child would help target chemotherapy and limit over-treatment, possibly resulting in an increased quality of life and infant survival. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) and use genomic input from a childâs tumor to test its predictive strengths to predict disease progression, identify critical disease drivers and compare results to current clinical statistical-based algorithms. PredictNeuroB is based on the network interactions of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) developmental signals and is supported by our discovery of a critical role for trkB and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during SNS development. Our published modelâs prediction of early stage neuroblastoma (for infants 0-2yrs old) using genomic information of 77 children is more accurate than any current clinical prognostic (Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2018). In this study, we propose to strengthen the predictive capability of our model for a broader class of patient data (age, stage of disease, chromosome status, MYCN amplification) by applying Gabriella Miller Kids First neuroblastoma databases. Further, we will perform in silico perturbations of the algorithm to determine critical drivers capable of altering neuroblastoma outcome states. At the conclusion of our study, by using a larger set of patient-derived data with associated clinical and disease outcome information, we expect our PredictNeuroB model will prove highly predictive for a broad class of neuroblastoma patients and support clinical decision making in disease treatment and targeted drug therapies. Project Narrative Neuroblastoma accounts for half of all childhood cancers in infants younger than 1 year, yet there is no diagnostic tool to accurately predict disease progression and outcome. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) that is based on the developmental signaling network from which neuroblastoma originates and test its capability to more precisely predict disease outcome using a childâs genomic information as input. By leveraging the information in Gabriella Miller Kids First databases we will test PredictNeuroB for a broader class of children than available in published academic data, resulting in a precise and personalized prognostic tool with the possibility to increase infant quality of life and survival by limiting over-treatment and targeting chemotherapy.",Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma,10193881,R03HD105079,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cancerous', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'MYCN gene', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Research', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Staging System', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Testing', 'Tumor Markers', 'Uncertainty', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'intelligent algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'nervous system development', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'receptor', 'risk variant', 'surgical risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NICHD,STOWERS INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R03,2021,165000
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a âprecision medicineâ approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicareâs inception in 1965. Medicareâs coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are âreasonable and necessary,â which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the programâs coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimerâs Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the âreasonable and necessaryâ threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicareâs inception in 1965 - Medicareâs coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are âreasonable and necessary,â which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimerâs Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,10137860,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126700
"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physicianâs intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expertâs actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human expertsâ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human plannerâs actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect expertsâ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. Jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc, this project will develop and translate an artificial intelligence planner that is capable of efficiently generating high quality treatment plans.",Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning,10143143,R01CA254377,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning progression', 'model development', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'product development', 'prototype', 'response', 'routine practice', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,626797
"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with â¥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve â¥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve â¥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target.

"Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder Abstract  Major depressive disorder contributes substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. Standard treatments are ineffective for up to a third of patients, so new treatment options are needed along with strategies to make more effective use of existing treatments. However, progress in expanding therapeutic options has been hindered by heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course of depression.  In other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and dementia, identifying disease subtypes has led to therapeutic discoveries. In major depressive disorder, efforts to identify subtypes based on clinical observation have yielded limited success, primarily because of the lack of availability of adequate cohorts for replication, and because those features most apparent to clinicians may not be the most relevant for differentiating subgroups. Efforts to leverage large electronic health record data sets for subtyping address some of these challenges, but standard approaches may not yield human-interpretable features nor those with value in prediction.  The investigators have developed methods for engineering features that balance utility in prediction with interpretability. Preliminary work by the investigators during a year of R56 support yielding 4 publications demonstrates that this approach indeed yields coherent topics without sacrificing predictive validity; electronic health records contain meaningful data that facilitates identification of interpretable patient subgroups. The present study draws on very large cohorts of individuals with major depression, defined by a validated algorithm, in electronic health records from two health systems. It will first apply methods developed by the investigators to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will then be examined in terms of predictive validity as well as interpretability by clinicians.  The study builds on a productive collaboration between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotyping and clinical investigation, analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health records, and development and application of innovative methods in machine learning that yield interpretable models rather than black boxes. Data-driven disease subtyping will facilitate clinically useful risk stratification as well as biological study of mood disorders. Narrative  The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to develop new treatments and make effective use of existing treatments. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records will enable the identification of interpretable disease subgroups, enabling development of more targeted treatment strategies.",Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder,10211310,R01MH123804,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'precision medicine', 'risk stratification', 'standard care', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,832192
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remissionâ (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,10129431,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2021,490569
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.  Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.  Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.  Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning. Project Narrative  This project will develop truly-â2Dâ proton-photon joint optimization methods for clinically-deliverable truly- hybrid RT with unprecedented superior plan quality to proton-only and photon-only RT, and first-of-its-kind TPS to bridge truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic. This hybrid TPS can facilitate prospective clinical trials of a broad spectrum of treatment sites for many patients. If succeed, truly-hybrid RT via this first-of-its-kind TPS will likely warrant improved clinical outcomes with reduced OAR toxicities, and potentially become a new paradigm for cancer RT in general, with compelling benefits in both treatment cost and clinical outcomes.",Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy,10207870,R37CA250921,"['Automobile Driving', 'Bathing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Equipment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Immobilization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Travel', 'Treatment Cost', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical application', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,356850
"Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and machine learning (ML) to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying treatment failure in young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD). Young adults are at particularly high risk of OUD and fatal opioid overdose. The monthly injectable extended-release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a highly effective OUD treatment and is particularly well suited for young adults. However, XR-NTX adherence and relapse show considerable individual variability, and the behavioral and clinical factors associated with such variability remain inconclusive. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for multimodal MRI and ML techniques to elucidate the neurocognitive factors that contribute to treatment response beyond behavioral and clinical measures. This project will take advantage of the cutting-edge MRI and ML methods to model brain structures and functions that predict XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD. The study will evaluate 18â34 year-old OUD patients before and during the first three months of XR-NTX treatment, a period associated with the highest rate of dropout from treatment. The primary outcome will be opioid relapse confirmed by weekly urine toxicology and self-report. The secondary outcome will be non-adherence defined as failure to complete the first three injections. The study will focus on five baseline measures of brain structures and functions that are potentially predictive of treatment response: 1) grey matter volume; 2) functional connectivity with the ventral striatum; 3) reactivity to opioid cues; 4) inhibitory control; and 5) self-evaluation. ML techniques will be used to reveal the patterns of brain structures/functions that are associated with each outcome variable. Based on literature and preliminary findings, we anticipate that combining MRI with behavioral and clinical assessments will better account for individual variability in XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD, than using the behavioral and clinical variables alone. The data will unveil novel brain mechanisms that contribute to the risk of treatment failure in this critical population. The project will also serve as a training vehicle for Dr. Zhenhao Shi to improve his clinical and computational skills and facilitate his independent career development. Specifically, it will enable Dr. Shi to achieve five training goals: 1) to advance his knowledge in the methodology of clinical research; 2) to gain hands-on experience in leading clinical projects; 3) to master ML and multivariate methodologies; 4) to apply multimodal MRI techniques to translational and clinical research; and 5) to advance his general independent research skills including leadership, networking, collaboration, scientific writing and grantsmanship. Through a combination of didactic and hands-on activities, the project will fulfill Dr. Shi's training needs and enable his transition to a successful and independent research career in applying advanced computational approaches to the neuroscience research of substance use disorders and their treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques to elucidate the structural and functional brain mechanisms underlying treatment failure in young adults receiving treatment with injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid use disorder. This project will unveil the neural mechanisms underlying individual variability in XR-NTX treatment response in a population of high importance to the efforts to curb the opioid crisis. It will facilitate Dr. Zhenhao Shi's transition to an independent computational addiction neuroscientist and help inform future research of, and intervention strategies for, opioid addiction.",Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction,10214440,K01DA051709,"['Abstinence', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'ROC Curve', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Self-Examination', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2021,179874
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression,10321686,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R01,2021,373023
