"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10203751,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,146767
"Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use,10073490,R00DA042127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tweens', 'Work', 'adolescent drug use', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'career', 'design', 'drug abuse prevention', 'flexibility', 'girls', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'residence', 'societal costs', 'successful intervention']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2021,313933
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,10092137,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,460884
"Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. In 2018, malaria affected more than 213 million people in Africa alone and claimed 381,000 lives, more than 65% of whom were African children less than 5 years old. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM, incorrect treatment, and resulting mortality or neurological disability. The specificity of the current standard of care for clinical diagnosis of CM (physical symptoms, coma, and malaria parasite test such as rapid diagnostic testing) is reported around 61%. Therefore, there is a significant market need for a highly specific, low-cost, and easy-to-use test to improve CM diagnosis and save lives. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 95% specific to the presence of CM, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. Screening for MR in addition to the current standard of care improves the specificity of CM diagnosis from 61% to 100%. VisionQuest Biomedical has developed ASPIRE, the first fully automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera, a system that can be operated by minimally trained personnel such as medical technician or nurse without the need of an ophthalmic specialist. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of regulatory consultants, commercialization experts, business development specialists, and clinicians; to clinically deploy and launch ASPIRE in our target market in Africa. This team will validate and prepare ASPIRE for regulatory clearance as well as finalize the marketing and commercial rollout strategy. In Phase II-B, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical deployed a fully-functional clinical version of ASPIRE and tested it in nine malaria clinics in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In CRP, ASPIRE will be validated for technical and clinical performance and will be brought to commercial readiness with regulatory clearance. We will accomplish this through four specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be validated to bring it under design controls. In the second aim, we will deploy ASPIRE at 25 clinics in Africa to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as to promote market traction. The third aim will focus on preparing ASPIRE for regulatory submission. In the fourth aim, we will complete African healthcare market research for a startup market of 5 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda) and finalize marketing and rollout strategy. Within one year after CRP, our goal will be to deploy ASPIRE in more than 200 malaria clinics across 5 countries in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which claims hundreds of thousands of lives of African children every year. The detection of retinal biomarkers of CM, called malarial retinopathy, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10170244,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,213780
"Longitudinal Antibody Profiles Correlated with Protection from Malaria in Malawi PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria continues to be responsible for substantial childhood mortality in Africa despite current control efforts. Developing an effective vaccine for malaria elimination is constrained by knowledge gaps in both naturally- acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. Existing vaccine candidates elicit antibodies against the target antigen but the associations between antibody functional activity and level and duration of protection are unknown. Additionally novel blood-stage antigens that could be used in future vaccines aimed at preventing symptomatic malaria have emerged (some are polymorphic), that need to be further investigated. Preferred antigens should elicit antibody functional activity that is: i) boosted with natural infection; ii) long-lasting; iii) correlated with protection; iv) not highly strain-specific, i.e., effective against a diversity of isolates. Our study aims to clarify these unknowns focusing on 12 understudied blood-stage antigens (and the alleles of those polymorphic antigens) to inform selection of antigens that could be potential vaccine candidates.  Prior studies of naturally-acquired antibody immunity have largely quantified antibody magnitude to specific proteins and have typically been limited to quantifying immune responses infrequently or at a single time-point. Because the immune profiles of individuals are dynamic and a function of exposure to infection that cannot be synchronized at the beginning of a study, these largely cross-sectional measurements obscure outcomes of interest. Furthermore, prior studies predominantly measured only magnitude of IgG responses; few have assessed the range and breath of functional activities of antibodies, and the impact of antigen polymorphisms on functional antibody activities.  The expertise of our study team, combined with access to samples collected during a longitudinal study with intensive follow-up and a comprehensive study approach, provides an opportunity to address these questions and elucidate the importance of these antigens in acquired immunity to malaria. Our study will be based on a cohort of children and adults who were seen monthly over two years in which subjects had repeated clinical and/or sub clinical malaria infections. Studying this cohort will enable us to gain new insights into the durability and boosting over time of functional antibody activity against blood-stage antigens upon natural exposure to malaria. We will also evaluate the cross-reactivity or strain-specificity of functional antibodies against alternative alleles of polymorphic antigens. Finally, we will evaluate antigens (and alleles) against which functional antibody activity is correlated with protection from symptomatic malaria and high density parasitemia, and we will seek signatures of functional responses that can accurately discriminate protected and unprotected subjects. These correlates of protection will provide endpoints for evaluating future vaccines. This may have implications for strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Development of an effective vaccine to combat malaria is hampered by knowledge gaps in malaria immunity. The general objective of our study is to inform selection of antigens for evaluation as potential vaccine candidates and establish approaches and principals that can be applied in future larger studies. We will use data from parasite genetics, new analytical approaches, and antibody functional activity targeting novel antigens that have promise as future vaccine candidates.",Longitudinal Antibody Profiles Correlated with Protection from Malaria in Malawi,10128971,R21AI151459,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Africa', 'African', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antibody-mediated protection', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Beds', 'Blood', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health care facility', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Malawi', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Time', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'acquired immunity', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'international center', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2021,276326
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,10097958,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2021,185224
"Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine ABSTRACT Despite annual investments of >$3 billion for intensive control measures, in 2018, the 228 million cases of malaria were an increase of ~16 million cases over 2015, and no decrease in number of deaths. The impact of available malaria control measure has plateaued. Moreover, WHO estimates deaths from malaria could double across sub-Saharan Africa this year due to disruptions in access to control measures due to the current global COVID-19 pandemic malaria. New tools, especially a vaccine, are needed. Only broad deployment of an effective vaccine holds the promise of true elimination or eradication, especially in the face of sudden developments like COVID-19. More than 98% of all deaths from malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Thus, a vaccine against Pf malaria is the priority. Sanaria is moving in 2021 to Phase 3 clinical trials of its Pf sporozoite (SPZ), PfSPZ Vaccine, and is planning for marketing authorization (licensure) from FDA and EMA in 2022/2023. Over the next 5-10 years we aim to decrease the cost of goods (COGs) and efficiency of production of PfSPZ vaccines so they can be used most effectively and economically by individuals who suffer the most from malaria. Microdissection of mosquitoes is a crucial step in extraction of PfSPZ vaccine products, and ensures a 10,000-fold purification away from irrelevant mosquito parts as the starting material for downstream purification procedures that then achieve a final product purity of 99.9%. To-date, mosquito salivary gland PfSPZ have demonstrated in vivo infectivity/potency superior to those extracted from whole mosquitoes, or grown outside a mosquito. However, extraction of mosquito salivary glands is a rate-limiting, labor-intensive, expensive step in production of PfSPZ-based vaccines. The overarching aim of this proposal is to enable implementation of an interim semi-automated dissection device in cGMP production of PfSPZ-based vaccines against malaria, and develop an integrated dissection system incorporating multiple automation steps downstream of mosquito orientation, for commercial-scale manufacturing. The unique application of robotic technology, state-of-the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms, and software systems to production-scale processing of very small insects in cleanrooms not only advances manufacturing capabilities, but also represents a spectrum of milestone innovations in automation. Success in this project involving a highly-skilled multi-disciplinary team of investigators, manufacturing and quality experts will decidedly lead to further streamlining and process optimization during the key step of isolating mosquito salivary glands for manufacture of our highly effective PfSPZ-based vaccines. The breakthroughs that initially defined a vaccine that is far superior to competing technologies in both safety and protective efficacy, will continue, as we advance in the proposed studies to make vaccine extraction more cost-effective due to greater efficiencies, mitigation of human error and operator fatigue, reduced timeframes, greatly reduced training periods, and increased product purity, towards deployment of a highly-impactful tool in the fight against malaria. Malaria claims upwards of 600,000 human lives each year, with more than 1,000 children succumbing every day. Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines against malaria have demonstrated outstanding safety and efficacy in numerous clinical trials. The manufacturing procedure for PfSPZ-based crucially involves a currently labor-intensive process of mosquito salivary gland extraction entirely by manual dissection. Our aim in this proposal is to first introduce an interim semi-automated dissection fixture for this process. In parallel efforts, incorporating automation in key steps of mosquito decapitation, and extraction of glands will lead to greater efficiencies, reduce timeframes, greatly reduce training times, mitigate human error and operator fatigue while maintaining product purity and quality that is thought to underlie an incredible safety record of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines. These outcomes will accelerate Sanaria’s march to licensure and production of commercial-scale volumes required to meet demand for post-licensure distribution to populations with greatest need, world- wide.",Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine,10258416,R44AI134500,"['Africa South of the Sahara', 'Authorization documentation', 'Automation', 'Body part', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comb animal structure', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Culicidae', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Decapitation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissection', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Geometry', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Insecta', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Licensure', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microdissection', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molds', 'Needles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Salivary Glands', 'Scheme', 'Sporozoites', 'Stainless Steel', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vaccines', 'Vision', 'base', 'cGMP production', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'fight against', 'human error', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'process optimization', 'protective efficacy', 'prototype', 'robotic system', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",R44,2021,1000000
