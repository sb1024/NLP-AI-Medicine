"Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may prefer to avoid these interventions.  To address these gaps, we have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led, video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication, increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. We will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids that we have developed. The ACP Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the palliative care team. The ACP Educator, who will be a palliative care nurse, will work with older patients or patients with ADRD and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.  The overall objective is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 by expanding the reach of inpatient palliative care, especially for patients with ADRD. We propose to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of an ACP Educator intervention among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over, or any patient with ADRD and their proxy decision-makers in the ward and ICU settings of two major hospitals: Boston Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital. Patient outcomes will be abstracted from electronic health records with Natural Language Processing. We will evaluate intervention effectiveness by comparing the following outcomes among 9,000 hospitalized patients: ACP documentation; preferences for resuscitation; palliative care consults; and, hospice use. We will characterize caregiver-centered outcomes of patients with ADRD, including: (1) knowledge, (2) confidence in future care, (3) communication satisfaction, and (4) decisional certainty in 600 caregivers of patients with ADRD admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 poses a unique dilemma for older Americans and patients with ADRD and their caregivers, who must balance their desire to live against the risk of a lonely and potentially traumatic hospital death. Video decision support is a practical, evidence- based, and innovative approach to assist patients facing such choices. If proven effective, this innovative care model can be immediately deployed across the country to improve the quality of care for millions of Americans. The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. We aim to improve ACP with an ACP Educator who will promote ACP conversations with certified video decision aids in a model of care that is practical, scalable, and evidence-based, has the potential to mitigate communication barriers related to health literacy and limited English proficiency, and has the potential to improve the quality of medical care delivered to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia,10251623,R01AG072911,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Boston', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communication', 'Communication Barriers', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limited English Proficiency', 'Loneliness', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Palliative Care Nursing', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'University Hospitals', 'Work', 'aged', 'care systems', 'compare effectiveness', 'dementia care', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health literacy', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'pandemic disease', 'patient-clinician communication', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'visual information', 'ward']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2487017
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,10062524,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,553209
"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short- to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one- third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third-order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARS- CoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10195454,R21LM013683,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Judgment', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protective Agents', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Shock', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'cyclooxygenase 1', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'demographics', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'global health emergency', 'high risk', 'human data', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label use', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'preclinical study', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'public health emergency', 'sex']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R21,2021,1
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548

"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,10131844,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,174917
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,10231005,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,539888
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on our elderly population living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In particular, care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is extremely challenging due to their special needs and difficulty adhering to social distancing requirements. This administrative supplement under the Stanford Aging and Ethogeriatrics (SAGE) Research Center (P30 AG059307) will examine the emotional distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dementia risk in racial minorities. Aim 1 will examine the extent to which COVID-19-imposed emotional distress mediates the association between childhood social distress and late-life increased risk of dementia by race. Aim 2 will examine the mental health and coping strategies of aging minority residents in nursing homes during the COVID- 19 pandemic by recruiting respondents in nursing homes in selected segregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMAs). These results are expected to shed new light on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the effects of emotional distress on minorities living with dementia and how coping strategies may help to mitigate that risk and the provision of dementia care. Our results from both Aims will be integrated and complement each other by providing robust statistical evidence on the association between stress and ADRD as well as first-hand evidence and perspectives from residents and caregivers, who are currently at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project Narrative: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely taking an enormous toll on the mental health of elderly minority patients and their caregivers in long-term care facilities. The results of this administrative supplement project will provide significant insights into the emotional impact of the pandemic on patients with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and ultimately lead to the design of more effective coping strategies for handling stressful events and improve the overall provision of care.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE),10268030,P30AG059307,"['Accounting', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Late Effects', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Race', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'aging population', 'comorbidity', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'dementia care', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'emotional distress', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health economics', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial discrimination', 'racial minority', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stressor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,197125
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10192851,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,191054
"COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has manifested in children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to devastating acute respiratory symptoms, appendicitis (often with rupture), and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15 million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and computational approaches to identify both population- and individual-level risk factors for severe illness. Our underlying hypothesis is that a combination of multidimensional data – clinical, sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and biological -- can be integrated to predict which children are at greatest risk to have severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants) and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks, including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim 3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community and environmental contexts, and informed by the REASSURED framework specified by the RFA. The models and biomarkers developed through our nationwide network of networks will produce generalizable knowledge that will improve our ability to predict which children are at greatest risk for severe complications of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. This knowledge will facilitate interventions to prevent and treat severe pediatric illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide public health problem. Pediatric disease has been particularly difficult to manage since children tend less frequently to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but, when they do become ill, can present with life-threatening pulmonary disease or a systemic inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The proposed COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) will develop models and biomarkers that predict risk for severe disease in children and adolescents by systematically integrating social science, epidemiological, genetic, biochemical, immunological, and computational approaches.",COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children),10273971,R61HD105619,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Appendicitis', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RADx', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Social Sciences', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Health Resources and Services Administration', 'Virus', 'base', 'case control', 'case finding', 'coronavirus disease', 'data resource', 'developmental disease', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'saliva sample', 'severe COVID-19', 'social', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'translational approach']",NICHD,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R61,2021,840235
"A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to PAR-20-237, “community interventions to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among health disparity and vulnerable populations,” we propose to study a parent-focused mentalizing intervention with a smartphone health platform in vulnerable populations in the Bronx. The Bronx—the poorest borough in New York City (NYC) with 84% of its population comprised of minorities—has been hit disproportionally by the COVID-19 pandemic. For caregivers in the Bronx, the pandemic has caused unprecedented psychological distress; in addition to combating social determinants of health (SDOH), these families now face greater financial insecurity and challenges related to their school-aged children. Furthermore, social distancing requirements and limited telehealth resources for Bronx families have posed greater barriers to healthcare. Such parental distress contributes to heightened risk of transgenerational cycles of psychological stress, trauma and maltreatment. Addressing these challenges, we propose a multimodal study tackling both parental vulnerability and healthcare access. a) Targeting parental vulnerability, we propose to build upon our 12-session therapeutic CARE program, which utilizes Mentalization Based Therapy and designed for parents of children in treatment in a community psychiatry clinic in our health system. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of attachment-based parenting interventions, including from our group in disadvantaged cohorts from the Bronx. b) Targeting healthcare access, we propose to utilize the HIPAA-compliant and IRB-approved Valera Health smartphone application (“app”), which has been studied in our health system in selected cohorts and resulted in greater access to healthcare. Building upon our work and clinical infrastructure, we hypothesize that both the CARE program and the Valera app will mitigate the psychological effects of COVID-19 while enhancing access to healthcare in the Bronx. The study will take place at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), the largest health system in the Bronx, which serves predominantly racial and ethnic minority individuals from underserved families. We will focus on three highly vulnerable cohorts: a) caregivers of children with psychiatric conditions (N=130); b) caregivers of children with autoimmune illnesses (N=130), and; c) caregivers who are frontline healthcare workers at MMC (N=100); all presenting with moderate stress. A RCT with 4 arms (2 x 2 design) will test our hypothesis: a) CARE program alone; b) CARE program + Valera app; c) Parent Education (PE) alone; d) PE + Valera app. Smartphones and connectivity will be provided as needed. Surveys at study enrollment, 6-, 12- and 24-weeks will assess parental stress, mentalizing capacity (reflective functioning), access to healthcare, mood and anxiety and additional parent and child clinical measures. Machine learning approaches will explore complex patterns as predictors of outcome including COVID-19 illness/deaths, medical comorbidity, housing, poverty, psychopathology, age, family functioning, and trauma. Impact. This multimodal study addresses key strategies to mitigate the psychological and health impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Our proposed prospective research, focusing on examining the effectiveness of both a telehealth platform and an innovative treatment approach for parents and primary caregivers as well as frontline healthcare providers who are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to provide support to these highly vulnerable groups based in the Bronx who normally encounter significant barriers to basic care. If successful, the study has the potential to offset several of the negative social determinants of health typically encountered by members of these vulnerable communities. As such, the clinical implications of our proposed research are potentially profound.",A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx,10261854,R01MH126821,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Autoimmune Process', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'maltreatment', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'perceived stress', 'primary caregiver', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial minority', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'social health determinants', 'substance use treatment', 'telehealth', 'therapy design']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,50000
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,10178076,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'complex data', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'lung injury', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,680901
"Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults (< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19 and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as MIS-C. We will then validate our newly developed diagnostic and prognostic algorithm to distinguish MIS-C from other inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations, including Kawasaki disease, and predict the longitudinal risk of complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE SARS-CoV-2 infection has harshly impacted health care outcomes in children and young adults. This groundbreaking project will employ multiple state-of-the-art technologies and approaches to evaluate children and young adults (<21), enrolled in the United States and Colombia, across the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Covid-19 to identify and validate biomolecules or bacterial signatures with diagnostic and prognostic value.",Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),10273778,R61HD105613,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensor', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Cardiac', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colombia', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Genetic', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mind', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Native Americans', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'RADx', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virus', 'Youth', 'acute infection', 'arm', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker signature', 'biosignature', 'care outcomes', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fight against', 'gut-brain axis', 'instrument', 'microbiome analysis', 'mortality', 'pediatric patients', 'plasmonics', 'potential biomarker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R61,2021,877921
"In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression ABSTRACT The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which early this year forced entire countries into lockdown, has reached a global death toll of 890,000+ by early September 2020. Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases that are asymptomatic but infectious, an estimated reproductive rate of infection of about 2 and a high mutation rate, it is expected that the virus will remain in the population as the influenza virus does. For hospitals serving areas whose economy relies on international travel, tourism, and cruise ship tourism, such as Miami-Dade county, new COVID-19 cases related to travel will require treatment during infection outbreaks which will strain health systems, especially during the infectious respiratory disease season in the winter. Patient risk factors during the current COVID-19 outbreak as well as during other viral outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza, are poorly characterized, consequently negatively affecting patient care. The saliva microbiome, which includes viruses and bacteria, is not currently used as in diagnostic tools. However, it may reveal risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome, and it allows for the detection and study of the viral RNA sequence for potential contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, all of which affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy. In this proposed study, Lifetime Omics will develop CLAIRE, a proof-of-concept in vivo cluster AI platform for predicting disease progression of viral infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 through the analysis of the saliva metagenome. The University of Miami Medical Group Infection Control (UMMGIC) division will collaborate in this effort by collecting saliva samples from COVID-19 patients with de-identified clinical information. The samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing and Lifetime Omics will repurpose algorithms used for prediction of in vivo HIV evolution to perform genetic/phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences, estimating mutation rate and immune selection pressures and identifying both the in vivo quasispecies clusters and the geographic cluster to which the patient belongs. The CLAIRE models will be trained with public datasets and tested on the metagenomic sequences generated from saliva samples of UMMGIC patients with the goal of assisting physicians in predicting disease progression in COVID-19. NARRATIVE During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for physicians admitting new patients to the hospital to distinguish patients whose disease will be mild from those who will have a severe disease progression. While this can also occur with the seasonal flu and other infectious respiratory diseases, the degree of severity seen in COVID-19, the potential of accelerated deterioration, and the high pressure on hospital resources for extended periods of time present a compelling and urgent need to better understand and anticipate the risk factors that may drive severe disease. Lifetime Omics is developing CLAIRE, a viral cluster AI system for prediction of infectious respiratory disease progression, such as COVID-19, using metagenomics and AI to provide personalized information to inform treatment decisions, help improve outcomes, and better utilize healthcare resources.",In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression,10256828,R43EB030947,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Contact Tracing', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Influenza', 'International', 'Lifting', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Infection', 'Process', 'Quarantine', 'RNA Sequences', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Ships', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'anti-viral efficacy', 'base', 'co-infection', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'health care service utilization', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'influenzavirus', 'markov model', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'negative affect', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient subsets', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'reproductive', 'saliva analysis', 'saliva sample', 'seasonal influenza', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vaccine efficacy', 'viral RNA']",NIBIB,"LIFETIME OMICS, INC.",R43,2021,248723
"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population. Narrative Dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19.

"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,10274232,R01NR020105,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'COVID detection', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID test', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Residential Facilities', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'demographics', 'design', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'drug rehabilitation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'higher education', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'rehabilitation service', 'remote health care', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics', 'stem', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance study', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1121730
"COVID-19 disease course analysis using multi-site large-scale EHR data Project Summary/Abstract  Since its ﬁrst case reported in December 2019, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pan- demic in 188 countries/regions, and has precipitated an unprecedented health, economic and social crisis. In order to cope with the volatile dynamic and severity of the pandemic, it is imperative that we characterize the various clinical courses of COVID-19 infection, and determine whether and how demographic, clinical and other variables inﬂuence them. Knowledge of the disease's transmission, symptomatology, clinical course, treatment and outcomes is rapidly evolving based on many sources. An important source for advancing this knowledge is data from electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchanges (HIE) because they can pro- vide a real-time, unvarnished view of the disease. Using large-scale, well-integrated and rich EHR data enables comprehensive proﬁling and quantiﬁcation of the COVID-19 disease course that can directly inform clinical prac- tice. The long-term goal of our research is to develop Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) tools to facilitate access to and analysis of clinical data. The goal of this application is to develop effective algorithms and tools to mine clinical data to categorize disease courses of COVID-19, and determine the effect of clinical and other variables asso- ciated with them. We will develop our algorithms using data from a large and comprehensive health information exchange, the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), which has about 40,000 COVID-19 patients and fairly complete EHR data about them. We will evaluate the algorithms against other data sets, including EHR data from the OSU Wexner Medical Center and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). The speciﬁc aims of this project are to (1) develop COVID-19 disease course groupings, (2) relate comorbidities and other clinical variables to the COVID-19 disease course, and (3) validate the developed algorithms on N3C data. This pro- posal is signiﬁcant because the methods developed in this project have the potential to signiﬁcantly increase our capability for computational analysis of large and rich patient data during the pandemic and beyond; the knowl- edge derived from our comprehensive proﬁling of COVID-19 courses over large, inclusive patient populations supported by rich EHR data can positively impact clinical practice; and the tools developed in this project will be released to the public as a free COVID-19 research re- source. It is innovative because our methods integrate novel methods such as patient clustering using clinical variables and disease progression trajectories, and pa- tient trajectory comparison, with established univariate and predictive analysis; our primary approach will lever- age the oldest and one of the country's largest HIEs to derive detailed and comprehensive knowledge about a large patient population; and the strong preliminary data generated by this project can help improve COVID-19 patient phenotyping, disease characterization and diagnosis.

"NBER Center for Aging and Health Research OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Lessons for COVID-19 from the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 There is currently great concern about the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue is how non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) impact the spread of the disease and, hence, fatality rates. A second is the inequality in infection rates and deaths across people with different socioeconomic characteristics. The goal of this project is to draw lessons for today from the Great Influenza Pandemic, which began in spring 1918, peaked during a second wave in late 1918 and early 1919, persisted through 1920, and cumulatively killed 40 million people worldwide. Using a combination of cross-city and cross-national analyses, the project will study how disease outcomes from the Great Influenza Pandemic relate to variations in population demographics and patterns of NPI use. The project will assess how disease outcomes relate to the types and durations of non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions implemented across geographic locations and over time. It will characterize the NPIs that were adopted during the Great Influenza Pandemic in terms of type, intensity, and duration of application. Among the NPIs to be considered are school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. The project will analyze variations in infections, deaths, population demographics, and NPI use across at least 45 large US cities, 48 countries, and cities in Spain and England, where high-frequency data are available on flu-related excess mortality. The project will be conducted as a supplement to grant P30-AG012810, the NBER Center for Aging and Health Research.

"Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY Background: We are experiencing an event unlike any in living history. The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. The size, scope, and speed of this pandemic has created an imperative for rapid dissemination of data and findings. The response of US primary care practices to COVID-19 is a large-scale natural experiment of the capacity of primary care to meet the majority of people's needs. And yet, at the start the pandemic in the US, there was no one organization, federal agency, or national dataset able to provide real-time on-the-ground data regarding the experiences of primary care practices or their patients. Purpose: On March 13, 2020, as the US declared COVID-19 a national emergency, our team created a national research Collaboratory and launched the “Quick COVID-19 Primary Care Survey” (C19 Survey) to fill that gap. The Pilot C19 Survey began as a clinician-based weekly national survey to monitor the response, challenges, and capacity of US primary care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 4 weeks, we launched a complementary patient-based C19 Survey. People Are Primary would allow the C19 Surveys to continue beyond the Pilot stage. We will examine the responses, challenges, and capacity of primary care practices in order to evaluate the resilience and adaptive decision- making required during the pandemic. Drawing on both patients and clinicians, we will examine the rapid adoption of digital health by primary care as well as the positive and negative consequences of digital health on 1) access to care across varied settings, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with relationships between primary care patients and primary care teams. Methods: This is a mixed-methods learning evaluation with an exploratory sequential design. Regular surveys will be distributed to identified clinician and patient groups throughout the 2-year study period. These will begin weekly and will evolve into biweekly and then monthly surveys in response to changes in the natural evolution of the pandemic and subsequent primary care practice response. The research team will engage in weekly rapid learning cycles that complete data collection, analysis, dissemination, and adjustment to survey instrument within a 7-day period. The team will also use bimonthly deep learning cycles to develop time series and trend- based analysis, offering a more extended conversation of these findings and their implications for the long-term stability and strengthening of the US primary care platform. Benefit: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the costs of chronic and fragmented under-investment in primary care. Examination of the rapid adoption of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care.

"Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2 One of the most poorly understood yet clinically important aspects of the novel COVID-19 SARS CoV2 coronavirus is the marked heterogeneity that it displays with infection severity and with development of end organ complications and mortality. SARS CoV-2 infection has a complex epidemiologic interplay with cardiovascular (CVD) and highlights this complex heterogeneity. The biology underlying this heterogeneity in CVD outcomes is poorly understood and concomitantly, clinically useful biomarkers do not currently exist to identify the highest risk patients in need of the most intense monitoring. Thus, we propose to use integrated omics and EHR data in a diverse multi-center North Carolina cohort with existing biological specimens to determine the role of inflammation, metabolism and novel molecular mechanisms, and identify biomarkers of CVD outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We propose to (1) Determine the clinical predictors of infection severity in a diverse population of individuals with CVD risk factors and SARS-CoV2 infection including evaluation of racial differences; (2) Determine the role of inflammatory, SARS-CoV-2 related, and other candidate proteins as biomarkers of infection severity and CVD outcomes in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection; and (3) Evaluate metabolic pathways in SARS Co-V-2 infection severity and CVD outcomes. The proposal has high potential for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the heterogeneity between CVD and SARS CoV-2 outcomes. Importantly, it has great short-term potential for clinically important results that will lead to earlier and better identification of high-risk patients for more intensive monitoring; novel therapeutic interventions to prevent end organ complications and mortality; and diagnostic and disease-progression biomarkers. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, it is emerging that patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and pre-existing CVD appear to have a worse severity of infection. Furthermore, CVD complications appear to be relatively common in patients with COVID-19 regardless of pre-existing CVD. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict who will develop the most severe infection and who will develop CVD complications. Technologies have evolved such that hundreds of proteins and other markers and millions of genetic markers can be rapidly measured in small amounts of blood. Thus, in this proposal, we will use these cutting-edge technologies in blood samples collected from patients with COVID-19 from two large medical centers in North Carolina, to identify biomarkers that can tell us those patients who will have the most severe infections and those patients who have suffer CVD complications, as well as identifying the genes that may predispose patients to these complications.",Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2,10303644,R21AI158786,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Angiotensins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inpatients', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'North Carolina', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Technology', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'secondary outcome', 'thrombotic']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,255940
"Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently over 7.4 million people in the US have confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 and over 215,000 have died. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, which disproportionally affects elderly patients. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 triggers such severe pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recent clinical studies have suggested that cell death, especially the induction of necroptosis, may be predictor of severe COVID-19 disease. The mechanism by which the host restricts necroptosis is unclear. In the preliminary data we have shown that the interferon induced protein, ISG15, acts as a negative regulator of necroptosis and its downstream inflammatory responses during viral infection. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 induces necroptosis and that ISG15 functions as a negative regulator of necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells. We will use in vitro primary tracheal epithelial cultures (hTECs) and an in vivo mouse adapted SARS-CoV2 animal model to ask several questions including: 1) Does SARS- CoV2 induce necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells; 2) Does ISG15 modulate necroptotic cell death as well as proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in respiratory epithelial cells during SARS-CoV2 infection?; 3) Does necroptosis and its regulation by ISG15 contribute to SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis? Overall, our studies will provide important insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection and provide potential insight into mechanisms underlying severe disease, which may direct efforts toward the development of diagnostic markers and future countermeasures. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality. It remains unclear why certain populations, particularly the elderly, are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of this work is to determine whether excessive inflammatory cell death, regulated by ISG15 and RIPK3, acts as a key factor in severe COVID-19 disease.",Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection,10287787,R21AI163822,"['2019-nCoV', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Avian Influenza', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'CRISPR screen', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HMGB1 Protein', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'ISG15 gene', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory Response Pathway', 'Interferons', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'RIPK3 gene', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Source', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Tropism', 'Ubiquitin Like Proteins', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viral Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'genome-wide', 'high risk population', 'human coronavirus', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'severe COVID-19', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196875
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500
"Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has evolved as a new threat to children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), we will collect clinical data and samples to support the proposed studies. First, we will generate transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses. Next, we will use these data to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our established collaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2- infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work will leverage already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/NoGo criteria have been established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data will be deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity. The synergistic expertise of these investigative teams in this multi-center proposal provides a unique opportunity to create diagnostic and prognostic tools for children suffering from the spectrum of SARS- CoV-2 illnesses. 1 Project Narrative As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved in early 2020, case reports appeared describing children with unusual febrile illnesses with elevated inflammatory markers and multi-system involvement that is now termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The illness occurs weeks following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and these children have a wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from cardiogenic shock to milder illness that can be self-limited. To address an urgent, unmet clinical need, investigative teams across three countries will join forces to discover and validate a diagnostic test to identify children with MIS-C and predict progression of disease.",Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness,10271147,R61HD105590,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody-Dependent Enhancement', 'Antigens', 'Aptamer Technology', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Burn injury', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'California', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fever', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industrialization', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'London', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Molecular', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 antibody', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'human coronavirus', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning method', 'pediatrician', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'testing services', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vaccine development']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R61,2021,698415
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support.

"Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients Abstract As of May 2020, over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally with over 400,000 associated deaths. Around 5-20% of patients develop critical illness, which predominantly manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome. When this develops, the estimated mortality is around 40%, and as high as 80% in ventilated patients. Several early reports describe the development of an excessive inflammatory response, the so-called `cytokine storm', which is strongly associated with rapid deterioration in clinical condition and mortality. Early reports of kidney transplant recipients, who are at high risk due to chronic immunosuppression and additional comorbid diseases, portray a concerning picture. In one series of 36 patients, 39% required mechanical ventilation, 21% required renal replacement therapy, and 28% died. Of the 11 patients that were intubated, 64% died. However, there is still an unmet need of understanding disease natural course, specific risk factors, identifying biomarkers, as well as potential impact of COVID-19 on graft/patient survival in vulnerable KTRs. To fill this information gap, we propose a comprehensive observational analysis of epidemiological factors and immunological assay results in COVID19-infected KTRs at 2 medical centers at the epicenter of COVID19 infection in NYC (Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx). We hypothesize that specific recipient clinical characteristics affect COVID-19 clinical course and that recipient immunosuppression in KTRs alters the ability of COVID-19 KTRs to develop protective anti-COVID-19 humoral and cell-mediated immunity that contributes to the morbidity and mortality of these individuals. We will test this hypothesis by 1) examining risk factors of COVID-19 severity in a large dataset of KTRs and individuals from the general population with COVID-19 (aim 1); 2) by characterizing the COVID-19 reactive humoral and cellular immune response in serially collected samples from COVID-19 KTRs (aim 2); and 3) by comprehensive assessment of DNA and serial serum, RNA, and PBMC from COVID-19 KTRs to identify disease mechanisms and potentially informative biomarkers for outcomes (aim 3). The proposed work is significant because of the high incidence of the disease, rate of community transmission, high mortality, and absence of clearly effective therapeutic options. Our studies will be amongst the first to define risk factors, predictors, and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 in Kidney transplantation and may apply to recipients of other transplanted organs, as well as to individuals on chronic immunosuppression due to autoimmune diseases. Project Narrative: In this application we propose to study COVID-19 disease from SARS-CoV-2 virus in the unique risk population of Kidney transplant recipients. Using data and bio-samples from two hospital systems at the forefront of this pandemic and the highest COVID-19 case loads, we wil identify clinical and biomarker risk profiles for disease severity in transplant patients with COVID disease. In addition, we will use novel assays for humoral and cell-mediated immunity to study COVID immune responses in these immunosupppressed patients and compare with controls.",Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients,10241179,U01AI063594,"['2019-nCoV', '3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Case Series', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Critical Illness', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiologic Factors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'General Population', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graft Survival', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppression', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kinetics', 'Longevity', 'Lymphopenia', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 immune response', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severity of illness', 'Surface', 'System', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immunosuppressed', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'study population', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,598676
"The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long- term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care, would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and recommendations for future policy implementation. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies have been shown to disparately impact socially vulnerable and under-served minority groups in the US. This proposed study develops an innovative approach to analyzing the effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on American Indian populations living on tribal lands and in rural areas, by integrating big data and deep learning techniques with primary data collection.

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188709
"Impact of chronic ethanol consumption on lung functional and immunological landscape and implication for susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection PROJECT SUMMARY As of the submission of this proposal, over 38 million cases of COVID-19 including a million deaths have been reported worldwide. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that can range from a mild to a severe/fatal disease characterized by excessive lung inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and multi-organ failure. Current studies suggest a major role for myeloid cell subsets in the development and exacerbation of disease, but the precise roles of lung-resident macrophages and infiltrating monocytes in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains poorly understood. It is already well-established that chronic heavy alcohol drinking (CHD) is a significant risk factor for developing ARDS and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with pneumonia. CHD is also associated with increased susceptibility to both bacterial and viral pulmonary infections, notably respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), community-acquired pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Defects in epithelial barrier as well as anti-microbial functions of alveolar macrophage are believed to be major causes for increased vulnerability to respiratory diseases in individuals with CHD. Despite the clear association between CHD and increased risk of severe pulmonary infections, no studies to date have examined the impact of CHD on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol drinking alters lung-resident myeloid cells leading to exacerbated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral clearance. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage a rhesus macaque model of voluntary ethanol self- administration that accurately mirrors human physiology and recapitulates complex human drinking behavior. Using this model, we recently demonstrated that CHD results in transcriptional and epigenetic rewiring of circulating monocytes and splenic macrophages, resulting in aberrant inflammatory responses. Additional preliminary studies show enhanced production of inflammatory factors with reduced type I IFN response to RSV infection as well as decreased phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages in CHD animals. We will first examine the impact of CHD on the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional landscape of lung-resident immune cells. Then, we will examine the impact of CHD on the response of lung-resident immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Completion of these experiments will allow us to define CHD-mediated differences in the lung immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that modulate COVID19 disease progression and severity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, can result in severe lung pathologies and inflammatory cytokine storms in individuals with underlying health conditions. Chronic heavy alcohol use and misuse increases risk for several lung infection, but whether CHD is a risk factor for COVID-19 disease remains unknown. The proposed research aims to identify the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on immune response to SARS-CoV-2.",Impact of chronic ethanol consumption on lung functional and immunological landscape and implication for susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection,10288563,R01AA028735,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 pathogenesis', 'COVID-19 susceptibility', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Interstitial Pneumonia', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phagocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Pathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shelter facility', 'Stress', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'alcohol misuse', 'antimicrobial', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'insight', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistics', 'synergism', 'theories', 'thrombotic complications']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2021,69281
"AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected (future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review.

"CT and CXR Phenotyping Platform for Assessing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity Abstract COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11. Since then, there have been 8.15 million confirmed cases worldwide with a case fatality rate ranging from 16.3% to 0.1%. In the US, there have been 2,187,202 cases with a 5.4% case fatality rate as of June 16, 2020. The magnitude of this infectious disease has stressed the need to develop novel methodologies to define who are at the highest risk of developing acute symptoms. X-Ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) play a fundamental role in the detection and follow-up of the COVID-19 lung injury. It also provides a unique opportunity to define quantitative biomarkers that may identify susceptible subjects to the acute phase of the disease using pre-infection and early infection radiological exams. This proposal's broad objective is to provide a better understanding of acute COVID-19 susceptibility markers based on artificial intelligence approaches on radiological exams, both CT and CXR. CT offers a unique way to phenotype the lung and its changes. Subtle changes of normal parenchyma have been associated with systemic inflammation that can be detected on CT. We hypothesize that susceptible subjects for acute COVID- 19 disease evolution will express inflamed normal parenchymal signatures that can be measured on CT scan prior to the infection or in the early phases of the viral infection. We will develop new computational approaches to identify radiographic patterns consistent with inflamed normal parenchyma as well as early COVID-19 injury and compute radiomics signature that can capture the heterogeneity of the radiographic expression for each lung pattern. We will define new CT-based biomarkers for acute COVID-19 susceptibility using Gradient Boosting decision trees and feature importance. We will then translate the quantification of the most relevant features in CXR image using image translation approaches based on deep neural networks. Finally, we will integrate these automated tools in the CIP workstation using clinically friendly end-to-end workflows to empower clinical investigations across the world. We will continue the support and dissemination of this tool across the research community. Over the last 15 years, our group has developed the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP), an NIH-funded open-source software tool for the automated phenotyping of chest CT scans that is widely used in the chronic lung disease research community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, CIP has been used to the characterization of COVID-19 using existing densitometric metrics. Our commitment to open science in the form of open toolkits that are freely distributed is fundamental to catalyze the application of AI and imaging in the context of this pandemic. Project Narrative As of June 16, there has been 2.18 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States with 118,435 fatalities. Unlike many other diseases, only general epidemiological factors are available for describing the susceptibility to COVID-19 and its acute phase.

"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients.

"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463
"Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics PROJECT SUMMARY When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15 West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the 2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations, particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches; (2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics. We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed project is to improve inference, forecasting and decision making in response to emerging infectious diseases by developing a framework to integrate mechanistic and statistical approaches to epidemic modeling and causal inference. Approaches developed will be validated using simulations and retrospective data and applied prospectively to reduce morbidity and mortality in emerging public health crises.

"Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Project Summary This predoctoral fellowship will provide the applicant (Hayley Falk), a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, with the skills necessary to become an independent research investigator with expertise in novel applications of machine learning for TBI. The limited accuracy of current models for early prediction of GCS 3-8 TBI (commonly referred to as severe TBI) outcomes (prognostic models) is a major barrier to improving the clinical care of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI. Less than 20% of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI experience a good neurologic recovery and currently there are no therapeutic agents that improve long-term outcomes. In GCS 3-8 TBI clinical trials of promising therapeutic agents, a favorable outcome is typically defined as a better outcome than would be expected, taking into account the predicted prognosis for each individual patient. Therefore, accurate estimation of predicted prognosis is critical to assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The leading prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI, IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury), have undergone extensive external validation, however, the discriminative accuracy is highly cohort dependent with AUCs as low as 0.60 in some patient groups. The two major limitations of the IMPACT and CRASH models include one-time measurements of clinical predictor variables and regression-based methods, which are not designed to handle complex, multidimensional datasets. Our objective is to derive a dynamic prognostic model which provides updated outcome predictions as new data becomes available. We will then develop a clustering algorithm to identify physiologically distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous, high frequency data streams. Our proposed goals will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) we will derive a dynamic prognostic model using a RNN (recurrent neural network)-based framework and data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2) which provides updated 6-month outcome predictions every 24 hours; and 2) using time series hierarchical clustering and continuous measures of physiologic parameters collected from subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 during the first two weeks post-injury, we will identify distinct subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that our dynamic prognostic model derived from time-varying data will have a higher discriminative accuracy (AUC) than a static prognostic model (similar to IMPACT and CRASH) derived using single timepoint data collected on the day of injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI characterized by continuous physiologic parameters such as increasing ICP (intracranial pressure), decreasing CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure), and decreasing PbtO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) will be associated with poor 6-month outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed project aims to address the limitations of current prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI using state- of-the-art machine learning techniques including RNNs (recurrent neural networks) and time series hierarchical clustering. Using time-varying data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from GCS 3-8 TBI subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2), we will use a RNN-based framework to derive a dynamic prognostic model which improves upon the accuracy of existing static TBI prognostic models and a time series hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous physiologic parameters and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome.

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10212363,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,71224
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swab and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19,10273964,R61HD105618,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'BLase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 assay', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'California', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Critical Illness', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'FDA Emergency Use Authorization', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'RADx', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'SARS-CoV-2 genome', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'cell free DNA', 'clinical assay development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'genetic pedigree', 'nasal swab', 'novel strategies', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2021,863810
"Experimentally guided modeling and simulation for cholera dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global pandemic at present. Quantitative research is urgently needed to clarify the impacts of the current vaccination campaign on the pandemic evolution and economic growth, and to guide future policy development. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new computational modeling framework for an investigation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US, and to incorporate real data to assess the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination on public health and the economy. To achieve this objective, the team will pursue three specific aims: (1) Modeling the transmission and spread of COVID-19 under the impact of vaccination; (2) Modeling the economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination; (3) Conducting a case study for the Chattanooga region in the state of Tennessee. The proposed research is significant because it will incorporate detailed characteristics and potential limitations of the current vaccination campaign (such as the vaccine efficacy, phased allocation schemes, public resistance to vaccination, and vaccine breakthrough due to new variants of SARS- CoV-2) into a sophisticated modeling framework, which will enable us to make more accurate forecasts on the progression and long-term evolution of the pandemic. As such, the project is expected to advance the current understanding of COVID-19 transmission and to quantify the interaction between epidemic spreading, economic growth, and disease prevention and intervention under the impact of COVID-19 vaccination, all of which are important for the control and management of the pandemic. The approach is innovative in the development of a computational framework that integrates novel mechanistic and machine learning models and that connects the epidemic and economic aspects of COVID-19. The innovation of this project is also reflected by the integration of sophisticated computational modeling, rigorous mathematical analysis, intensive numerical simulation, and detailed data validation. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration among an applied and computational mathematician with long-term interest in infectious disease modeling (Wang), an epidemiologist with extensive working experiences at CDC and a current member of the regional COVID-19 task force (Heath), a business and management professor with a background in public heath (Mullen), and a statistician with expertise in machine learning and biomedical data analytics (Ma). The success of this project will not only build a solid knowledge base for the complex transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 vaccination, but also provide important guidelines for the government agencies and public health administrations in pandemic management and policy development. Project Narrative The proposed project is relevant to public health because a deep understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and its health and economic impacts will help to inform the pandemic management and improve the current practice in disease prevention and intervention. The mathematical and machine learning models developed in this project will improve such understanding and make new knowledge discovery. This research effort aligns with part of NIH's mission to reduce public health burdens of infectious diseases.",Experimentally guided modeling and simulation for cholera dynamics,10376956,R15GM131315,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Attention', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 vaccination', 'Case Study', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Economic Factors', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Policy Developments', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Administration', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Route', 'SARS-CoV-2 transmission', 'SARS-CoV-2 variant', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Unemployment', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'computer framework', 'disorder prevention', 'dynamic system', 'economic impact', 'economic indicator', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health economics', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'professor', 'programs', 'simulation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'vaccine efficacy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE CHATTANOOGA,R15,2021,122580
