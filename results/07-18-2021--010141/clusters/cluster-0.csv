"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",9715158,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,581271,0.03037771672770847
"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,9818963,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'learning strategy', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,341716,0.01417460412888217
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9597237,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web server', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,343124,0.044343577316498496
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9688116,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,275934,0.07475274039014813
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9633923,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2019,294912,0.01836427155851468

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.

"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT.

"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs.

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures.

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9008644,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2016,343124,0.044343577316498496
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9106828,R01AR068456,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,31678,0.07475274039014813
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.            ",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,8869145,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2015,91800,0.04316829031175061
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,8111224,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2011,227860,0.012058760299098569
"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem.

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7467275,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2009,233457,0.012058760299098569

"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances. The long term goal is to create a meta-server that will become a standard and will revolutionize the protein structure prediction field in an analogous way to the revolution that PSI-BLAST brought about in the sequence-comparison field, a few years ago. n/a",Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server,7576912,R01GM073814,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Code', 'Complement Factor B', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Jackals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Running', 'Services', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2009,239823,-0.008741842538551998
"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies,7658677,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28202,0.0026853820667133445
"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.

"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances.

"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies,7546079,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'concept', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,32027,0.0026853820667133445
"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.

"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.  Here, we propose a variety of technical and scientific solutions improving the functionality of PredictProtein. (1) The technical solutions address job and data handling, database update, user interface, web page layout, presentation of results, and directly linking original resources. (2) The systematic combination of methods requires evaluating these in parallel on identical tasks, e.g., at which level of probability should a signal peptide prediction override the membrane prediction. Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals).

"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis. Using          budding yeast genetics and digital imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we will           identify molecular components, including MT motor proteins, that are involved        with the coupling of force generation to the assembly/disassembly of MTs. We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs. Finally, we will analyze how MT dynamics may be involved in the               regulation of cytokinesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION,6635816,R01GM024364,"['Urodela', ' Xenopus', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell cycle', ' cell motility', ' centromere', ' chromosome movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system hardware', ' contact inhibition', ' cytoskeletal proteins', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' meiosis', ' microtubules', ' mitotic spindle apparatus', ' nanotechnology', ' photoactivation', ' protein binding', ' protein biosynthesis', ' protein structure function', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture', ' video microscopy', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2003,347106,0.01574315911814831
"VIRUS STRUCTURE DETERMINATION SOFTWARE Virus structure determination using electron microscopy has become a useful research tool aimed at understanding viral assembly and infectivity to facilitate the design of anti-viral drugs and virus-based gene delivery systems. Our long term goal is to broaden the group of people able to determine virus structures by providing an integrated software suite for three-dimensional virus structure determination using electron microscopy. The software suite, called Tumbleweed, will allow easy, efficient, and routine determination of icosahedral virus structures from electron micrographs. Novel aspects of Tumbleweed will include a comprehensive suite of tools for icosahedral structure determination, incorporation of an expert system to guide users through the reconstruction procedure, and data analysis tools to ensure that structures are determined accurately. Tumbleweed will also provide a consistent easy to use graphical user interface to all reconstruction tools including data analysis, data management, and data logging. In addition, Tumbleweed will provide tools for image selection, quality assessment, and structure visualization that can be used with any electron microscopy structure determination method. Thus, in addition to virologists, target users include electron microscopists and structural biologists. The result of this Phase Il SBIR will be a completely integrated and tested software package allowing easy, efficient, and routine virus structure determination. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Tumbleweed is targeted at a large group of users with varied knowledge, experience, and research goals. Virologists will be attracted to the extensive user guidance and intuitive design. Structural biologists and electron microscopists performing virus structure determination will be attracted to the concept of a complete integrated software package. Last, all electron microscopists and structural biologists will be attracted to the integration of all general data processing into a single extendible package.

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.

"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts.

We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.  n/a",PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,6182183,R21GM059398,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electron crystallography', ' electron density', ' molecular biology information system', ' physical model', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2000,101500,0.011054021946423092

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10019572,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'structured data', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,561173,0.03037771672770847
"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling. Narrative Cryo-electron microscopy is an emerging technique for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules.

"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).

This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,0.007982591741775777
"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",9897100,R01GM111645,"['Active Sites', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enzymatic Biochemistry', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical chemistry', 'cofactor', 'computer studies', 'design', 'electron density', 'enzyme mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular scale', 'movie', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'protein structure', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'synthetic biology', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,335664,0.007776707196309832
"Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three- dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A) understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:  1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a  label free and non-invasive manner  2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures  3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.  4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens. If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell— pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle, mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens. This proposed development of vibrational sum frequency generation microscopy, in the short term, will spatially resolve collagen tissues with chemical structure and molecular interaction information in a complicated environment. Machine learning and simulation approaches will be employed to build a data base to convert hyperspectral images of collagen into a spatial map with microscopic structures and molecular interaction information. In the long term, the fundamental biochemical knowledge learned from this development will lay foundations for rationally design biomedical approaches to monitor and control pericellular spaces and its interaction with cells, and further advance treatment to diseases related to it.",Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,10028946,R35GM138092,"['3-Dimensional', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Collagen Fibril', 'Collagen Type I', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Peptides', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Water', 'biophysical techniques', 'design', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'self assembly', 'simulation', 'vibration']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2020,393958,0.013939452743183905
"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,10001530,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360797,0.01417460412888217
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy Summary In the past decade, we have witnessed a revolutionary progress in camera technology and the attainable resolution of macromolecular assemblies via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting 3D maps to atomic resolution structures. Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs.

"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM).

"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9911975,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'patient response', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,276227,0.07475274039014813
"Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration PROJECT SUMMARY The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina, speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease. However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions, and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3) Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types, thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will enhance our understanding of nuclear genome organization and functions that are increasingly being linked to health and disease. Because we develop tools to disseminate this information and enable others to work with our data and their own data, we will also bring nuclear architecture to bear on a broad range of ongoing health related research. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration,10156141,UM1HG011593,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytology', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interphase Chromosome', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cycle genetics', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data exploration', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental function', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'multiscale data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,UM1,2020,2075409,0.009206003325569072
