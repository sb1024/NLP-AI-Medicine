"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related. The long- term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information.",Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia,9738055,R01DC017137,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Financial compensation', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phonology', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,303944,0.12291934538471141
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9729856,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,570779,0.041070218814563283
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9731439,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2019,39939,0.27853366958531484
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9674421,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,2193618,0.3043109954209547
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia.

This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9981076,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,103338,0.15155735324394598
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) To address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors. Aphasia, a language impairment caused by damage to the brain's language regions, persists chronically in approximately 30% of stroke survivors. POLAR is a treatment study that aims to identify neuroanatomical, behavioral, genetic, and demographic predictors of treated aphasia recovery in individuals with chronic left hemisphere stroke. Preliminary analyses have shown that not all individuals improve, and recent evidence suggests that approximately one-quarter of individuals with post-stroke aphasia experience cognitive-linguistic decline over time. The purpose of this project is to extend the follow-up window for the POLAR study, to one-year post aphasia treatment. There is evidence to suggest that declining performance in stroke-induced aphasia is attributed to pathologic changes in the brain's white matter, referred to as leukoaraiosis. Leukoaraiosis is common in stroke survivors, and is often attributed to age, as well as cardiovascular health and other health concerns. In the general population, it has been associated with cognitive decline and loss of functional ability. By extending follow-up interval for the POLAR study, this study will address a new aim of evaluating the progression of leukoaraiosis and how it affects overall cognitive-linguistic ability in stroke survivors. To this end, participants will undergo the same speech/language and cognitive testing administered at study baseline. Participants will also undergo the same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol as at baseline (see the attached POLAR Research Strategy). The extent of behavioral change will be evaluated and related to neuroanatomical changes. The role of cognitive reserve and other personal factors in mediating the effects of leukoaraiosis will also be explored. The world’s population is aging, and with this trend, the global burden of stroke and dementia is also increasing. The study of leukoaraiosis in post-stroke aphasia is critical for identifying factors that may indicate cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors, as doing so will also inform efforts to improve the evaluation of individuals at risk for developing cognitive impairment, AD, and other dementias (NIA Strategic Goal D-3). The world’s population is aging, and by 2050, it is expected that 17% of the world’s population (i.e., 1.6 billion people) will be over the age of 65 (1). Along with this increase in older individuals, the global burden of stroke (2) and dementia (3) is also increasing. The coming decades are expected to see a significant growth in the number of individuals living longer with post-stroke sequelae, attributed to the decline in stroke mortality rates (2, 4) and an increase in stroke rates in younger individuals (e.g., 20-44 years old (5); 45-64 years old (6)). In parallel, as individuals age, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias continues to increase (3). This epidemiological trend means that aging research must consider the effects of stroke on the aging brain – and likewise – stroke research must consider how processes associated with aging affect long term outcomes. In essence, stroke survivors are aging, and aging research must consider this population, especially considering that by 2030, the number of stroke survivors could reach 70 million people worldwide (2). Accordingly, to address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (CSTAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9951329,P50DC014664,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Employment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Leukoaraiosis', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aging brain', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'cardiovascular health', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive reserve', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'hemisphere damage', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'post stroke', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,372500,0.18395483535591492
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9686505,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,630166,0.1795699802068171
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9518014,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,580306,0.041070218814563283
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9612777,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2018,39939,0.27853366958531484
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery.

The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes.

"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9305153,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,587873,0.041070218814563283
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9449181,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,663165,0.1795699802068171
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.            ","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9150327,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'information organization', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,604285,0.041070218814563283
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9083041,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'wasting']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2016,2291632,0.3043109954209547
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests.

"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.            ",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,8758212,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Arteriogram', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasic', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language onset', 'language processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,445153,0.2132196865360775
"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia  Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.  PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"An Accessible, Effective Treatment for Sentence Deficit in Agrammatic Aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our work is to develop an accessible, effective and cost effective speech and language treatment for aphasia. To achieve this goal, we will develop a commercial prototype of a computer program called Sentactics based on over 15 years of research at Northwestern University that demonstrates the effectiveness of the program to improve speech production and comprehension skills of individuals with aphasia. Preliminary work funded by the NIH resulted in an initial version of the Sentactics program. A clinical trial revealed that individuals with agrammatic aphasia who used Sentactics improved their speech and language production and comprehension skills significantly, with gains equivalent to subjects who were administered the clinical treatment from expert human clinicians. This study also demonstrated that individuals with aphasia find the Sentactics program to be highly engaging and fun to use. Our project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a commercial prototype of an improved version of Sentactics that incorporates two new features: (a) a spoken language system that uses speech and natural language processing technologies to provide feedback to clients about the accuracy of their speech productions, and (b) a clinician oversight capability that enables individual clinicians to use the internet to monitor multiple simultaneous users of the program and communicate with individual users as needed. In Phase I of the project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of using the spoken language system to provide feedback to clients about the accuracy of their speech productions. In Phase II we will develop a commercial prototype of the program incorporating the spoken language system and clinician oversight functions. We will then field test the program with individuals with aphasia. We will compare changes in the speech production and comprehension abilities of individuals using the Sentactics program to individuals using a commercially available program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful outcomes of this project would result in a commercial prototype of an accessible, affordable, effective and easy to use speech and language therapy program for use by individuals with aphasia in clinics or homes.

"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related. The long- term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information.",Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia,9997876,R01DC017137,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Financial compensation', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phonology', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,283332,0.12291934538471141
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9944489,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2020,39939,0.27853366958531484
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9889924,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2020,2187036,0.2731925855476528
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9890992,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,986375,0.1795699802068171

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9988227,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,837117,0.15155735324394598
