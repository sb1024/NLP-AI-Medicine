"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9716320,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,677664,0.007257556153374969
"QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development   Children with autism struggle to recognize facial expressions, make eye contact, and engage in social interactions. Many of these children can have dramatic recoveries, particularly if social skills are taught from an early age. However, in today's healthcare system the delivery of the behavioral intervention is bottlenecked by a sharp and increasing imbalance in the number of behavioral therapists and the number of children in need of care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop mobilized methods of care delivery. We have developed an artificial intelligence tool for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass through an Android app and delivers instantaneous social cues to individuals with autism in their natural environment, providing therapy that today is given only by clinicians in non-scalable person-to- person sessions. The system leverages Glass's outward facing camera to read a person's facial expressions and passes facial landmarks to an Android native app for immediate machine learning-based emotion classification. The system then gives the child wearer real-time social cues and records social responses. We believe that the system's ability to provide continuous behavioral therapy outside of clinical settings will enable dramatically faster gains in social acuity that will, within a limited and self-directed period of use, permit the child to engage in social settings on his/her own. This proposal outlines three main aims needed to test, refine and optimize the tools and a series of validation experiments needed to bring our system from prototype to a viable clinical tool that every family can use regularly from home for precision healthcare. We have developed a combined software-hardware solution built on top of Google Glass that enables real lime expression recognition and field-of-view eye tracking to capture social interaction data and give guiding social cues to an individual with Autism. This project will test and optimize the potential of this tool to provide continuous and naturalized behavioral therapy to children with autism from their homes.",QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development  ,9749146,R01EB025025,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Precision Health', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Running', 'Self-Direction', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Marketing', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'deep learning', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'personalized health care', 'prototype', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,333071,0.047931429836996275
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9619075,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318386,-0.0004364506362734014
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9701324,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,613809,0.03868427840715989
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups Intricate social hierarchies that go through both dynamic and stable phases exist in species ranging from humans to mice to insects and have been richly described in psychology and ecology, but virtually nothing is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that govern the remarkable coordination of large groups of animals. Systems neuroscience has exploded with a number of novel technologies, yet the culture of this field has been largely reductionist – focusing on animals living in isolation or with a single-digit number of cage mates performing highly-controlled tasks. Although there is abundant ongoing research in the domain of social reward (motivation to engage in social behavior for hedonic value that social interaction provides), there is no ongoing research (to my knowledge) examining the neural representation of a negative valence need state (a loneliness-like state), the social homeostatic set-point, or how this is related to social rank. Indeed, this unexplored face of social behavior may have greater relevance to mental health and the burden on society. This proposal is completely different from any previous work done by myself or any investigator because we will do the following: 1) present a model for social homeostasis where social rank dictates the set-point for quality/quantity of social contact; 2) bridge behavioral ecology and systems neuroscience by using complex, naturalistic vivariums of large groups of mice in combination with nascent neural recording technology and expertise across a wide range of functional circuit dissection techniques; 3) simultaneously record across many brains using wireless recording devices to determine how composite dominance hierarchy is represented and determine whether meta-brain patterns for group social homeostasis (in both stable and dynamic phases) exist and observe how they change during dominance hierarchical reorganizations; and 4) identify site(s) and circuit(s) that represent social rank by applying machine learning approaches to decode ensembles that accurately predict the animal’s social rank, and use this information to move towards a mathematical model for social homeostasis on a supraorganismal group level. I propose to bring my expertise in modern systems neuroscience circuit dissection to reveal the neural underpinnings of social homeostasis on both an individual and group level. On an individual level, I seek to understand how deficits between the experienced social contact and the expectations dependent on social rank within a dominance hierarchy are represented within the brain, and how these signals are translated into motivational drive states. When investigating the neural representation of social homeostasis on the group level, we will record simultaneously in many animals using wireless devices within a naturalistic vivarium in a complex social hierarchy and look for a composite representation of the social supraorganismal group.",Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups,9751212,DP1AT009925,"['Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Dissection', 'Ecology', 'Face', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Knowledge', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Values', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'expectation', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'mathematical model', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social group', 'virtual']",NCCIH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP1,2019,1346800,0.06551043044678798
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9827207,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2019,254250,0.08180395682252387
"Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions (WASABI): a closed-loop mobile intervention to reduce social anxiety and improve social skills PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to further develop (to pivotal trial readiness) and evaluate WASABI (Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions)–a clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment, mobile application designed to augment the efficacy of psychological Evidence Based Treatments through a closed-loop technology. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Social Anxiety (SA), and test WASABI as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy (dCBGT). Via Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) WASABI will capture data on social anxiety, its underlying cognitive biases, and on social role performance. These data will populate a predictive machine learning algorithm that will alert the WASABI clinician and end- user of whenever social anxiety reaches clinical significance. The clinician will use this information to initiate synchronous or asynchronous Instant Messaging (IM)-based conversations with the goal of supporting, recommending and reinforcing relevant skills to alleviate the momentary distress, to increase social competence, and/or to improve contextual social role performance. Similarly, the clinician will leverage WASABI data to personalize dCBGT content during the weekly group video-calls. This individualized assessment, monitoring, and treatment approach is posited to induce flexible adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, and support the generalization of trained cognitive skills within the everyday lives of adolescents, thus improving their clinical and functional status. In Specific Aim 1, we will first involve three adolescents with SA and two clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine WASABI and qualitatively evaluate its manageability, clinical usefulness, and acceptability. Once decisions regarding the app and dashboard design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run, during which the predictive ability of the algorithm will be validated by the WASABI clinician, who will verify via 1:1 remote videocalls the actual presence of clinically-significant social anxiety whenever she receives an alert. Additionally, the test run will ensure that WASABI EMA data are timely evaluated by the clinician on the dashboard and meaningfully orient the delivery of individualized IM and weekly dCBGT content. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that WASABI is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of WASABI, we will conduct a pilot augmentation trial with 32 adolescents with SA who will be randomized to dCBGT+WASABI vs dCBGT only. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support a RCT in Phase II designed to establish medical claims defining the efficacy of this intervention. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness WASABI (Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions)–a clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment, mobile application designed to augment the efficacy of psychological evidence-based treatments. By processing Ecological Momentary Assessments data collected from mobile devices, the WASABI closed-loop algorithm detects exacerbation of social anxiety, and cues 1:1 and group-based Instant Messaging with peers and providers. In this Phase I trial, we will test WASABI as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy in adolescents with Social Anxiety, with the goal of promoting the generalization of trained cognitive skills in the natural environment, thus improving anxiety and social functioning.",Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions (WASABI): a closed-loop mobile intervention to reduce social anxiety and improve social skills,9847582,R43MH121209,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Group Therapy', 'Hour', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social skills development', 'Standardization', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Youth', 'adherence rate', 'anxious', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive skill', 'cognitive training', 'cost effective', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'functional status', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'peer', 'phase 2 designs', 'phase I trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social situation', 'social skills', 'usability', 'week trial']",NIMH,POSIT SCIENCE CORPORATION,R43,2019,243975,0.0392705520715472
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9769513,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,38616,0.02541100759108857
"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,9719997,R34MH119170,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Service delivery model', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavior test', 'college', 'cost', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'emotional distress', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'outreach', 'parental involvement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'self help', 'service delivery', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'uptake']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2019,244552,0.02968674880518029
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,9645277,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,393603,0.016591533075674413
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9652845,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,474391,0.07152754900249282
"Mining Social Media Messages for HIV Testing and Prevention Communication PROJECT SUMMARY With the advent of Big Data methods, social media is the proverbial low-hanging fruit to disseminate HIV prevention and testing messages on a large scale 1,2. These media already transmit messages on condom use, HIV testing, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), from government institutions, NGOs, private citizens, and community groups, but it does so in an informal way. This real-time repository of real-world health messages, along with our ability to mine and pinpoint counties that need to engage in a conversation about HIV prevention and testing, offers a unique opportunity to develop Big Data methods for geographically targeted message dissemination. Despite some interventions designed for online delivery 3–19, the overall potential of social media and their most promising contents (e.g., actionable messages with behavioral instructions) have surprisingly not been established to date. Our project will focus on the disease-burdened population of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM), and will develop a highly significant computing infrastructure (Aim 1) to automatically and continuously input social media postings from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, behavioral data from the American Men Internet Survey (AMIS), and HIV prevalence data from AIDSVu.org, and using that triangulation, to target counties that need social media messages about condom use, HIV testing, and/or PrEP for MSM. Using machine learning methods, the same platform will then select actionable and acceptable messages to fill county gaps. Once the platform has been refined with input from research participants who are employees of health departments, it will be used to send experimental messages (Aim 2), selected to match county needs, and to be actionable and acceptable to a group of health departments randomized to the experimental condition. The success of the experimental messages will be gauged by the hallmarks of social media, repostings, Likes, Dislike, and comment favorability, compared with the success of a random selection of HIV-relevant messages sent to a different group of health departments randomized to the control condition. The project is innovative in several ways. First, the social media messages will involve diverse inputs (text, images, videos) never before brought together in this area. Second, we are not aware of the prior use of the proposed triangulation involving epidemiological, behavioral, and social media data. Third, a method of mining naturally accruing messages will be new and transformative, allowing for the generation of “live” campaigns with messages selected that remain current, sustainable, and community-based by design. Further, the use of an implementation-science experiment at a large, geographically distributed, scale is highly novel. These research aims are facilitated by unique team expertise about communication and persuasion, Big Data methods, public health, and Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling, and leading institutions in the areas of psychology, public health, and computer science. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is concerned with identifying a method to disseminate public health information through social media in an optimal way.

"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9654779,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2019,694087,0.035592801975548954
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.

"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,9664686,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'age group', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'movie', 'neglect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive mood', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social neuroscience', 'young adult']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,674876,0.06756595419575327
"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods No abstract available Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems.

"The Molecular Underpinnings of Complex Social Behavior Humans are highly social. Our brains have evolved to recognize and interpret the expression of faces and to produce and process language. Our behavior is modulated by our social interactions, and defects in social cognition manifest themselves in various disorders, including depression and autism. However, it has remained challenging to model these conditions in classic genetic systems such as rodents and flies because they only display basic social behaviors. Social insects such as ants, on the other hand, have evolved sophisticated societies and social behaviors, including nestmate recognition and complex communication via chemical cues. Their behavior is contingent on the social environment, giving rise to cooperation and division of labor. We study ants to understand the basic genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Because most of the molecules that modulate social behavior, such as neuropeptides, biogenic amines, and epigenetic marks on DNA and histones are conserved from insects to mammals, many of the insights gained from ants will also be applicable to humans. Over the past five years we have developed tools for the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi, a species that combines complex social insect biology with unprecedented experimental control. We can now monitor social behavior using computer vision, measure, map, and pharmacologically manipulate candidate neuromodulators in the ant brain, and create stable gene knockout and transgenic lines using CRISPR technology. We will study the development, organization and activity of the ant antennal lobe, the part of the brain that processes the ants' sophisticated chemical language.

"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9675331,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569073,0.06046875595423988
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9731295,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'multimodality', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,125000,0.06597662382629207
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity.

"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9851722,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1010160,0.012946292254336437
"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses challenges that social media data pose for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data.

"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,9802580,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,530057,0.041833686590581634
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,9818197,R01LM012974,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Semantics', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'behavior change', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'digital', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'network models', 'nicotine patch', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2019,372890,0.05863671712942585
"QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development   Children with autism struggle to recognize facial expressions, make eye contact, and engage in social interactions. Many of these children can have dramatic recoveries, particularly if social skills are taught from an early age. However, in today's healthcare system the delivery of the behavioral intervention is bottlenecked by a sharp and increasing imbalance in the number of behavioral therapists and the number of children in need of care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop mobilized methods of care delivery. We have developed an artificial intelligence tool for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass through an Android app and delivers instantaneous social cues to individuals with autism in their natural environment, providing therapy that today is given only by clinicians in non-scalable person-to- person sessions. The system leverages Glass's outward facing camera to read a person's facial expressions and passes facial landmarks to an Android native app for immediate machine learning-based emotion classification. The system then gives the child wearer real-time social cues and records social responses. We believe that the system's ability to provide continuous behavioral therapy outside of clinical settings will enable dramatically faster gains in social acuity that will, within a limited and self-directed period of use, permit the child to engage in social settings on his/her own. This proposal outlines three main aims needed to test, refine and optimize the tools and a series of validation experiments needed to bring our system from prototype to a viable clinical tool that every family can use regularly from home for precision healthcare. RELEVANCE {See instructions): We have developed a combined software-hardware solution built on top of Google Glass that enables real lime expression recognition and field-of-view eye tracking to capture social interaction data and give guiding social cues to an individual with Autism. This project will test and optimize the potential of this tool to provide continuous and naturalized behavioral therapy to children with autism from their homes. n/a",QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development  ,9523415,R01EB025025,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Precision Health', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Running', 'Self-Direction', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Marketing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'applied behavior analysis', 'base', 'care delivery', 'deep learning', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'prototype', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'standard care', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,384860,0.04805869134794669
"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,9577760,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'therapy development']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,402500,0.022256955779170574
"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Using computer-vision based face analysis, statistical analysis (regression and ANOVA), and machine learning, we will investigate the relation among expressiveness, structural and functional asymmetry, and behavior problems in children with CFM.",Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years,9525940,R03DE026513,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Articulation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bell Palsy', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Burn injury', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Cranial nerve diseases', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial asymmetry', 'Funding', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malocclusion', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mobius Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Problem behavior', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unilateral Hearing Loss', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial disorder', 'craniofacial microsomia', 'design', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'malformation', 'outcome prediction', 'parent grant', 'peer', 'procedure cost', 'research clinical testing', 'social', 'social skills', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2018,154777,0.045240593130477826
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9524706,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,235500,-0.0334522113212047
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9402599,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,318898,-0.0004364506362734014
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9534747,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,663541,0.03868427840715989
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups Intricate social hierarchies that go through both dynamic and stable phases exist in species ranging from humans to mice to insects and have been richly described in psychology and ecology, but virtually nothing is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that govern the remarkable coordination of large groups of animals. Systems neuroscience has exploded with a number of novel technologies, yet the culture of this field has been largely reductionist – focusing on animals living in isolation or with a single-digit number of cage mates performing highly-controlled tasks. Although there is abundant ongoing research in the domain of social reward (motivation to engage in social behavior for hedonic value that social interaction provides), there is no ongoing research (to my knowledge) examining the neural representation of a negative valence need state (a loneliness-like state), the social homeostatic set-point, or how this is related to social rank. Indeed, this unexplored face of social behavior may have greater relevance to mental health and the burden on society. This proposal is completely different from any previous work done by myself or any investigator because we will do the following: 1) present a model for social homeostasis where social rank dictates the set-point for quality/quantity of social contact; 2) bridge behavioral ecology and systems neuroscience by using complex, naturalistic vivariums of large groups of mice in combination with nascent neural recording technology and expertise across a wide range of functional circuit dissection techniques; 3) simultaneously record across many brains using wireless recording devices to determine how composite dominance hierarchy is represented and determine whether meta-brain patterns for group social homeostasis (in both stable and dynamic phases) exist and observe how they change during dominance hierarchical reorganizations; and 4) identify site(s) and circuit(s) that represent social rank by applying machine learning approaches to decode ensembles that accurately predict the animal’s social rank, and use this information to move towards a mathematical model for social homeostasis on a supraorganismal group level. I propose to bring my expertise in modern systems neuroscience circuit dissection to reveal the neural underpinnings of social homeostasis on both an individual and group level. On an individual level, I seek to understand how deficits between the experienced social contact and the expectations dependent on social rank within a dominance hierarchy are represented within the brain, and how these signals are translated into motivational drive states. When investigating the neural representation of social homeostasis on the group level, we will record simultaneously in many animals using wireless devices within a naturalistic vivarium in a complex social hierarchy and look for a composite representation of the social supraorganismal group.",Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups,9536687,DP1AT009925,"['Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Dissection', 'Ecology', 'Face', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Knowledge', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Values', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'expectation', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'mathematical model', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social group', 'virtual']",NCCIH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,DP1,2018,1,0.06551043044678798
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9442821,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'participant retention', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2018,237842,-0.028890144592832102
"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9502368,R01MH110514,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Relationship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Robotics', 'Rodent', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'anti social', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mental health related disorder', 'model development', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'signal processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'success', 'technique development', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wearable device']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,414455,0.02908006604513107
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9470193,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38124,0.02541100759108857
"Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders NIDA's strategic planning emphasizes the need to increase the real-world relevance of research by prioritizing “research that incorporates real-world complexities including common comorbidities” that “interact to affect symptom profiles, illness trajectory, and treatment outcomes”.  The overall goal of the current application is to characterize the impact of the common comorbidity between psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and functional outcomes. Clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and pathways to functional outcomes in comorbid PSD+CUD will also be explored.  To do this, three existing datasets will be used, with comprehensive diagnostic, clinical, cognitive and functional data, including patients with comorbid PSD and CUD (PSD+CUD), and 3 comparison groups: patients with PSD without CUD, patients with CUD without PSD, and healthy controls without psychiatric disorder. This unique design, including all 3 relevant control groups, will allow to elucidate the combined effect of comorbid PSD+CUD, compared to the effect of PSD or CUD alone, on cognition and emotion processing, and test two alternate models: an additive model and a self- medication model. The present study will focus on 3 specific aims: 1) To characterize sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD; 2) To characterize cognitive and emotion processing impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD; 3) To characterize functional impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD, and to identify predictors and pathways to social functioning. ANOVAs and Chi- square tests will be used to compare the groups on sociodemographic features, clinical features, cognitive and emotion processing performance and functional outcomes. Linear and logistic regressions, structural equation modeling and machine learning will be used to identify predictors and model pathways to functional outcomes, taking into account possible mediators.  Data from this study will increase our understanding of the impact of comorbid PSD+CUD on cognition, emotion processing and pathways to functional outcomes. We will also characterize the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD. This will allow to identify those at risk for comorbid PSD+CUD, and to tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches, targeting specific factors identified in the models. For example, cognitive and emotion processing impairments are modifiable through cognitive/emotion processing remediation strategies. The overall goal of the current application is to examine the impact of the common comorbidity of psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and social functioning. We will also characterize the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of PSD+CUD and explore predictors and pathways to functional outcomes. Understanding the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and the factors that underlie functional outcomes, will allow to identify those at risk and tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches.","Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders",9599895,R03DA045094,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cannabis', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Control Groups', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Medication', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'cocaine use', 'comparison group', 'design', 'early onset', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'interest', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'remediation', 'research study', 'sex']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2018,127125,-0.02014767524094013
"Mining Social Media Messages for HIV Testing and Prevention Communication PROJECT SUMMARY With the advent of Big Data methods, social media is the proverbial low-hanging fruit to disseminate HIV prevention and testing messages on a large scale 1,2. These media already transmit messages on condom use, HIV testing, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), from government institutions, NGOs, private citizens, and community groups, but it does so in an informal way. This real-time repository of real-world health messages, along with our ability to mine and pinpoint counties that need to engage in a conversation about HIV prevention and testing, offers a unique opportunity to develop Big Data methods for geographically targeted message dissemination. Despite some interventions designed for online delivery 3–19, the overall potential of social media and their most promising contents (e.g., actionable messages with behavioral instructions) have surprisingly not been established to date. Our project will focus on the disease-burdened population of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM), and will develop a highly significant computing infrastructure (Aim 1) to automatically and continuously input social media postings from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, behavioral data from the American Men Internet Survey (AMIS), and HIV prevalence data from AIDSVu.org, and using that triangulation, to target counties that need social media messages about condom use, HIV testing, and/or PrEP for MSM. Using machine learning methods, the same platform will then select actionable and acceptable messages to fill county gaps. Once the platform has been refined with input from research participants who are employees of health departments, it will be used to send experimental messages (Aim 2), selected to match county needs, and to be actionable and acceptable to a group of health departments randomized to the experimental condition. The success of the experimental messages will be gauged by the hallmarks of social media, repostings, Likes, Dislike, and comment favorability, compared with the success of a random selection of HIV-relevant messages sent to a different group of health departments randomized to the control condition. The project is innovative in several ways. First, the social media messages will involve diverse inputs (text, images, videos) never before brought together in this area. Second, we are not aware of the prior use of the proposed triangulation involving epidemiological, behavioral, and social media data. Third, a method of mining naturally accruing messages will be new and transformative, allowing for the generation of “live” campaigns with messages selected that remain current, sustainable, and community-based by design. Further, the use of an implementation-science experiment at a large, geographically distributed, scale is highly novel.

"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9487048,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,474391,0.07152754900249282
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9432559,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,729487,0.035592801975548954
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,9484330,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'age group', 'base', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'movie', 'neglect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive mood', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social neuroscience', 'young adult']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,674022,0.06756595419575327
"Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Title: Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Abstract  Chronic disease management is largely dependent upon individuals’ engagement in adoption and modification of one or more health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence, daily exercise, smoking cessation) over long term. Despite prevalence of theory-guided behavior change interventions, behavior modification is oftentimes a chronic, relapsing effort in and of itself. The effect of social relationships and behavior change has been well documented, nonetheless, rarely infused into health interventions. Our understanding of (a) the mechanisms through which such influence affects human behaviors, and (b) how such influence can be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of theory-guided behavioral interventions is limited. In the proposed research, we will develop a set of semi-automated methods to characterize the interrelation between theory driven stages of behavior change and social influence models of human behavior in group settings, as embedded in user generated interactions on a health-related online community. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed based on communications among individuals attempting to quit smoking in an online community, QuitNet, the first online social network for smoking cessation. Advanced text analytics will be used to identify and extract the stages and processes of behavior change. Stage-oriented network affiliation models will then be used to characterize the interdependencies among social actors, behavioral processes, and behavioral states. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral stages and processes into network models of social influence; 2) scalable techniques to automate identification of behavioral stage through text annotation of user interactions; and 3) new proposals for the development of digital interventions and technology features that harness social ties and theoretical roots to support individuals engaging in health behavior change and chronic disease management.     This project investigates the manifestation of behavior change processes and stages in online social discourse focusing smoking cessation. As a component of the proposed research we will integrate automated text analysis and network models to understand social mechanisms and influence patterns underlying electronically captured peer-to-peer communication related to behavior modification. By enabling the study of content-specific communication events focusing on specific stages of change, the proposed research will provide actionable insights into the development of socio-behavioral interventions that target online communities and consider users’ behavioral state and stage. In addition, the research will provide understanding of the specific behavior change processes that trigger certain stage transitions.",Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse,9547350,R21CA220670,"['Abstinence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Semantics', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health management', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'network models', 'novel', 'online community', 'patient engagement', 'peer', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social networking website', 'theories']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2018,96425,0.044428480495298565
"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning. A number of experiments highlight an important difference between men and women that  we discovered during our last grant and follow up on here. Specifically, brain connections with the  prefrontal cortex in females explain how anxious they report being but we do not see this effect in  males. With this information, we can then better understand what goes wrong in the brains of  individuals with major depression and anxiety disorders.",Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning,9561940,R56MH080716,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Friends', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Same-sex', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social learning', 'social situation', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R56,2018,405000,0.034007324851999074
"The Molecular Underpinnings of Complex Social Behavior Humans are highly social. Our brains have evolved to recognize and interpret the expression of faces and to produce and process language. Our behavior is modulated by our social interactions, and defects in social cognition manifest themselves in various disorders, including depression and autism. However, it has remained challenging to model these conditions in classic genetic systems such as rodents and flies because they only display basic social behaviors. Social insects such as ants, on the other hand, have evolved sophisticated societies and social behaviors, including nestmate recognition and complex communication via chemical cues. Their behavior is contingent on the social environment, giving rise to cooperation and division of labor. We study ants to understand the basic genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Because most of the molecules that modulate social behavior, such as neuropeptides, biogenic amines, and epigenetic marks on DNA and histones are conserved from insects to mammals, many of the insights gained from ants will also be applicable to humans. Over the past five years we have developed tools for the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi, a species that combines complex social insect biology with unprecedented experimental control. We can now monitor social behavior using computer vision, measure, map, and pharmacologically manipulate candidate neuromodulators in the ant brain, and create stable gene knockout and transgenic lines using CRISPR technology. We will study the development, organization and activity of the ant antennal lobe, the part of the brain that processes the ants' sophisticated chemical language. We will also conduct a large unbiased screen to identify candidate neuromodulators that affect social behavior. We will then manipulate these candidates pharmacologically and genetically to describe their function in more detail. We will also genetically disrupt DNA methylation, a common epigenetic mark implicated in behavioral individuality and plasticity. Finally, we will study how communication and social behavior affect the performance of social groups in dynamic and challenging external environments. This work will elucidate how, on a molecular level, the brains of social partners interact. This work is innovative because it uses a novel and uniquely suited study species to take a complementary approach to important biological questions of biomedical relevance. It will produce additional tools and resources to further establish the clonal raider ant as a model system for behavioral genetics, and it will shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying social behavior, which can then be studied further in other species including humans. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental and mood disorders that entail severe social impairments such as autism and depression have been difficult to model in available genetic study systems due to a lack of complex social cognition. The proposed research will use the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi as a complementary model system to study the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of complex social behavior with an array of available molecular tools and behavioral assays. Given that many of the neuromodulators regulating social behavior are likely conserved between insects and mammals, this work will identify and characterize candidate molecular mechanisms that can then be studied further in other organisms, including humans.",The Molecular Underpinnings of Complex Social Behavior,9485732,R35GM127007,"['Affect', 'Ants', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individuality', 'Insecta', 'Language', 'Light', 'Lobe', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'communication behavior', 'fly', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social group', 'tool']",NIGMS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,423750,0.07342159633693282
"Cortical Spread of Hippocampal  Hyperactivity in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and, through its efferent projections, also contributes to other cognitive tasks. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of a mouse model of autism propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors. A deficit in social interaction is one of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, which includes Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice causes social behavior impairments reminiscent of autism spectrum disorders. The ventral hippocampus (vHIP) of Mecp2 knockout mice (KO) mice is hyperactive due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, which results in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize the influence of the vHIP on the activity of the mPFC through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection, testing whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and social interaction deficits. We hypothesize that hyperactive hippocampal afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance, which contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function and role in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and behavioral assessments. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; (2) characterize synaptic function and long-term synaptic plasticity of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; (3) test if chemogenetic modulation of vHIP activity restores mPFC network activity and social behaviors in Mecp2 KO mice. In addition to defining novel pathophysiological mechanisms of RTT, these studies will provide fundamental information regarding the functional and structural properties of the long-range monosynaptic connection between the vHIP and mPFC in typically developing brains. Thus, the impact of this work will extend beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is thought to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Cortical Spread of Hippocampal  Hyperactivity in Rett Syndrome,9650793,R56NS103089,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal', 'response', 'social', 'spatial memory', 'synaptic function', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R56,2018,457549,0.005586544238354319
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9523855,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594230,0.06046875595423988
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9545868,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,125000,0.06597662382629207
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity.

"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses challenges that social media data pose for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data.

"QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development   Children with autism struggle to recognize facial expressions, make eye contact, and engage in social interactions. Many of these children can have dramatic recoveries, particularly if social skills are taught from an early age. However, in today's healthcare system the delivery of the behavioral intervention is bottlenecked by a sharp and increasing imbalance in the number of behavioral therapists and the number of children in need of care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop mobilized methods of care delivery. We have developed an artificial intelligence tool for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass through an Android app and delivers instantaneous social cues to individuals with autism in their natural environment, providing therapy that today is given only by clinicians in non-scalable person-to- person sessions. The system leverages Glass's outward facing camera to read a person's facial expressions and passes facial landmarks to an Android native app for immediate machine learning-based emotion classification. The system then gives the child wearer real-time social cues and records social responses. We believe that the system's ability to provide continuous behavioral therapy outside of clinical settings will enable dramatically faster gains in social acuity that will, within a limited and self-directed period of use, permit the child to engage in social settings on his/her own. This proposal outlines three main aims needed to test, refine and optimize the tools and a series of validation experiments needed to bring our system from prototype to a viable clinical tool that every family can use regularly from home for precision healthcare. RELEVANCE {See instructions): We have developed a combined software-hardware solution built on top of Google Glass that enables real lime expression recognition and field-of-view eye tracking to capture social interaction data and give guiding social cues to an individual with Autism. This project will test and optimize the potential of this tool to provide continuous and naturalized behavioral therapy to children with autism from their homes. n/a",QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development  ,9394169,R01EB025025,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Running', 'Self-Direction', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Marketing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'applied behavior analysis', 'base', 'care delivery', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'prototype', 'response', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'standard care', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,373870,0.04805869134794669
"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development.

"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9297669,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,-0.0334522113212047
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9199411,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Study', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,319382,-0.0004364506362734014
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9402671,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohesion', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social stigma', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,237,-0.0011438672306137126
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups Intricate social hierarchies that go through both dynamic and stable phases exist in species ranging from humans to mice to insects and have been richly described in psychology and ecology, but virtually nothing is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that govern the remarkable coordination of large groups of animals. Systems neuroscience has exploded with a number of novel technologies, yet the culture of this field has been largely reductionist – focusing on animals living in isolation or with a single-digit number of cage mates performing highly-controlled tasks. Although there is abundant ongoing research in the domain of social reward (motivation to engage in social behavior for hedonic value that social interaction provides), there is no ongoing research (to my knowledge) examining the neural representation of a negative valence need state (a loneliness-like state), the social homeostatic set-point, or how this is related to social rank. Indeed, this unexplored face of social behavior may have greater relevance to mental health and the burden on society. This proposal is completely different from any previous work done by myself or any investigator because we will do the following: 1) present a model for social homeostasis where social rank dictates the set-point for quality/quantity of social contact; 2) bridge behavioral ecology and systems neuroscience by using complex, naturalistic vivariums of large groups of mice in combination with nascent neural recording technology and expertise across a wide range of functional circuit dissection techniques; 3) simultaneously record across many brains using wireless recording devices to determine how composite dominance hierarchy is represented and determine whether meta-brain patterns for group social homeostasis (in both stable and dynamic phases) exist and observe how they change during dominance hierarchical reorganizations; and 4) identify site(s) and circuit(s) that represent social rank by applying machine learning approaches to decode ensembles that accurately predict the animal’s social rank, and use this information to move towards a mathematical model for social homeostasis on a supraorganismal group level. I propose to bring my expertise in modern systems neuroscience circuit dissection to reveal the neural underpinnings of social homeostasis on both an individual and group level. On an individual level, I seek to understand how deficits between the experienced social contact and the expectations dependent on social rank within a dominance hierarchy are represented within the brain, and how these signals are translated into motivational drive states. When investigating the neural representation of social homeostasis on the group level, we will record simultaneously in many animals using wireless devices within a naturalistic vivarium in a complex social hierarchy and look for a composite representation of the social supraorganismal group.",Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups,9343478,DP1AT009925,"['Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Dissection', 'Ecology', 'Face', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Knowledge', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Values', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'expectation', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'mathematical model', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social group', 'virtual']",NCCIH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,DP1,2017,1018600,0.06551043044678798
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9383530,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,666777,0.03868427840715989
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9232220,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2017,259157,-0.028890144592832102
"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9320978,R01MH110514,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Relationship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Robotics', 'Rodent', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'anti social', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mental health related disorder', 'model development', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'success', 'technique development', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,420351,0.02908006604513107
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9286515,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,505201,0.07152754900249282
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9301669,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,709268,0.035592801975548954
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,9283803,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'age group', 'base', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'movie', 'neglect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive mood', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social neuroscience', 'young adult']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,675505,0.06756595419575327
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9208156,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,523129,0.017536829533930924
"Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Title: Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Abstract  Chronic disease management is largely dependent upon individuals’ engagement in adoption and modification of one or more health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence, daily exercise, smoking cessation) over long term. Despite prevalence of theory-guided behavior change interventions, behavior modification is oftentimes a chronic, relapsing effort in and of itself. The effect of social relationships and behavior change has been well documented, nonetheless, rarely infused into health interventions. Our understanding of (a) the mechanisms through which such influence affects human behaviors, and (b) how such influence can be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of theory-guided behavioral interventions is limited. In the proposed research, we will develop a set of semi-automated methods to characterize the interrelation between theory driven stages of behavior change and social influence models of human behavior in group settings, as embedded in user generated interactions on a health-related online community. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed based on communications among individuals attempting to quit smoking in an online community, QuitNet, the first online social network for smoking cessation. Advanced text analytics will be used to identify and extract the stages and processes of behavior change. Stage-oriented network affiliation models will then be used to characterize the interdependencies among social actors, behavioral processes, and behavioral states. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral stages and processes into network models of social influence; 2) scalable techniques to automate identification of behavioral stage through text annotation of user interactions; and 3) new proposals for the development of digital interventions and technology features that harness social ties and theoretical roots to support individuals engaging in health behavior change and chronic disease management.     This project investigates the manifestation of behavior change processes and stages in online social discourse focusing smoking cessation. As a component of the proposed research we will integrate automated text analysis and network models to understand social mechanisms and influence patterns underlying electronically captured peer-to-peer communication related to behavior modification. By enabling the study of content-specific communication events focusing on specific stages of change, the proposed research will provide actionable insights into the development of socio-behavioral interventions that target online communities and consider users’ behavioral state and stage. In addition, the research will provide understanding of the specific behavior change processes that trigger certain stage transitions.",Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse,9394563,R21CA220670,"['Abstinence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Semantics', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'network models', 'novel', 'online community', 'peer', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social networking website', 'theories']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2017,122425,0.044428480495298565
"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning. A number of experiments highlight an important difference between men and women that  we discovered during our last grant and follow up on here. Specifically, brain connections with the  prefrontal cortex in females explain how anxious they report being but we do not see this effect in  males. With this information, we can then better understand what goes wrong in the brains of  individuals with major depression and anxiety disorders.",Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning,9499980,R56MH080716,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Friends', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Same-sex', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social learning', 'social situation', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R56,2017,405000,0.034007324851999074
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9285649,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,125000,0.06597662382629207

My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results across studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media.",Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight ,9285056,K02DA043657,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Latina', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Media Campaign', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survey Methodology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career development', 'data mining', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'hookah', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'marijuana use', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social implication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2017,118137,0.052345753348863384
"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult.

"Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis remains one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the U.S., and current changes in legalization policy indicate broadening acceptability. At the same time, substance abusers have sought similar, or more enhanced highs, through use of synthetic cannabinoids, new designer drugs with constantly changing chemical formulations that have been linked to adverse health effects and present significant challenges to public health. Submitted in response to NIDA RFA-CA-14-008 (Research Area 1), this multi-PI study builds on multidisciplinary collaboration between the researchers in the Center for Interventions, Treatment, and Addictions Research, and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing at Wright State University to develop an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, that will facilitate analysis of trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the use of cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids as discussed on Web forums and Twitter. To date, no one has developed a computer platform capable of collecting and semi-automatically analyzing data from these two complementary social media sources. We will build on the existing infrastructure developed by our interdisciplinary research team: Twitris, a robust and highly scalable platform designed to analyze Twitter data, and PREDOSE, a platform developed for our collaborative NIH grant (R21 DA030571) to analyze Web forum data on illegal buprenorphine use. Key elements of Twitris and PREDOSE will be adapted and enhanced using Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning techniques to advance the analysis of social media data for drug abuse research and is thus maximally responsive to the RFA. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop a comprehensive software platform, eDrugTrends, for semi-automated processing and visualization of thematic, sentiment, spatio-temporal, and social network dimensions of social media data (Twitter and Web forums) on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. 2) Deploy eDrugTrends to: a) Identify and compare trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use across U.S. regions with different cannabis legalization policies using Twitter and Web forum data. b) Analyze social network characteristics and identify key influencers (opinions leaders) in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid-related discussions on Twitter. The development of eDrugTrends will advance the field's technological and methodological capabilities, and our deployment of the platform will inform the field on new trends regarding the use of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs. eDrugTrends will have high public health impact by providing a tool that can be used to inform more timely interventions and policy responses to changes in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use and associated harms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration between substance abuse researchers and computer scientists, we will develop and deploy an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, to facilitate analysis of Twitter and Web forum data on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. The study will contribute to the advancement of social media surveillance methods to improve public health, and it will provide timely information on emerging trends in the context of changing cannabis laws in the U.S. that can ultimately be used to inform interventions and policy.",Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use,9112982,R01DA039454,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cannabis', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Designer Drugs', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'K2/Spice', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ohio', 'Online Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'addiction', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'meetings', 'mental state', 'multidisciplinary', 'regional difference', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'substance abuse epidemiology', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend', 'trend analysis']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,460736,0.04066084167929753
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use. The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.",Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use,9029353,R01MH096951,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Gender', 'Generic Drugs', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'positive emotional state', 'skin color', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,452541,0.07179597971937904
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.            ",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9054574,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Study', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,331310,-0.0004364506362734014
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9120715,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social stigma', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,50507,-0.0011438672306137126
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9131476,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2016,346148,-0.028890144592832102
"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9160973,R01MH110514,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Relationship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Robotics', 'Rodent', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'antisocial behavior', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mental health related disorder', 'model development', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'success', 'technique development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,517160,0.02908006604513107
"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,9122340,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'racial and ethnic', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,386725,0.02995446423893341
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.        ",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9128362,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive process', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,827432,0.035592801975548954
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,9097801,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,562097,0.0064074505183525435
"Automated assessment using facial coding Abstract  Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the “age of instability"" and ""emerging adulthood"" includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college; identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes; coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which end at age 18. The emerging- adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm, and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health disorders that often co-occur with SUD.  In this phase 1 proposal we describe the development of a mobile app that uses exciting new technology (automated facial coding) to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. We describe the use of front-end focus groups to provide pre-development input on the app; we detail the app features and user experience; and define the app’s technical specifications. Phase 1 also includes a pilot feasibility study of the prototype product among TAY with SUD. They will have four weeks to use the app in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and post-evaluation using validated instruments to characterize the sample, quantity satisfaction and feasibility, evaluate emotion- and substance-related variables, as well as explore the app metrics and its technical performance. If positive results are found this would set us up well for phase 2, which could expand the app in some really interesting directions as well as further study it in a randomized controlled trial. The app product we envision would have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY’s ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be expanded to other populations. Our stellar team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical innovations, technology, and app development. Narrative We propose to help young adults (ages 18-26) who have substance abuse problems. Our goal is to help them learn more about their emotions in relation to their substance abuse as a way to ultimately help them reduce their substance use. We plan to use a sophisticated technology related to emotion recognition, and to use that to help support the young adults in learning more about managing their emotions. Our work will include the development of a mobile app related to these goals.",Automated assessment using facial coding,9199791,R43DA042640,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Forcible intercourse', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'HIV', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Nature', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Peer Group', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sexuality', 'Smiling', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'cloud based', 'college', 'craving', 'driving under influence', 'emerging adulthood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fighting', 'foster care', 'gang', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'killings', 'lens', 'literacy', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'visual stimulus', 'young adult']",NIDA,"TREATMENT INNOVATIONS, LLC",R43,2016,225000,0.0206500528235651
"Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18-20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long-term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components - the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of thes services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In our recenly completed Phase I STTR, we developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. Our VE, known as Pegasys-VR"", allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in-clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at-home solution). Our results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET-C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, our Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in-clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in-vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys-VR"" is as effective as traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow-up. If Pegasys-VR"" is clinically efficacious, it would offer a sustainable, cost-effective intervention that can be easily and rapidy disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among children, social anxiety is a common, severe and chronic disorder. Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) is an empirically supported treatment with significant potential to impact the lives of children with this severe and chronic disorder. The proposed Pegasys-VR"" system will distinctly enhance its utility, as it will allow dissemination to a broad variety of clinical settings including schools as well as traditional outpatient clinics. Its use for the treatment of social skills deficits will offer a superior soluton for mental health personnel, solving many of the resource and logistic barriers that they currently face. The final product will address cost and practical issues by disseminating an empirically-supported treatment that was rigorously built and tested. Using VE will make the traditional social skills therapy programs program cost-effective and patient-centric, allowing even clinicians with little background/training in behavior therapy to have tools not typically availabl to them.",Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety,9132841,R42MH094019,"['Academic achievement', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Community of Practice', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fluoxetine', 'Game Theory', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Logistics', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevalence', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Relaxation Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Youth', 'aged', 'childhood anxiety', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mental health personnel', 'natural language', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'pill', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'satisfaction', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'virtual human', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"VIRTUALLY BETTER, INC.",R42,2016,606792,0.03873034520467146
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9016572,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'motivational processes', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2016,523129,0.017536829533930924
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'depression model', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic significance', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,0.0171240647074276
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,9124921,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'dynamic system', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2016,504474,0.04158300877845492
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.",The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing,9033949,R01MH078829,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'AVPR1A gene', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anger', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'DRD4 gene', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'RGS2 gene', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'anxious behavior', 'base', 'design', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'lens', 'neurodevelopment', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social communication', 'stimulus processing', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,871361,0.06929366215804228
"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses challenges that social media data pose for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult.

Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings, setting the stage fr future research testing its value as a component of a smoking cessation intervention.",An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving,9240944,R01CA184779,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coping Skills', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Familiarity', 'Gender', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personality', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Smell Perception', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Vision research', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive process', 'coping', 'craving', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nicotine patch', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'olfactory stimulus', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'theories']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,54468,0.03488477937229211
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8908047,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'targeted imaging', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,193512,0.018910113232108325
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use. The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.",Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use,8816133,R01MH096951,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Gender', 'Generic Drugs', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'positive emotional state', 'skin color', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,452541,0.07179597971937904
"Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis remains one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the U.S., and current changes in legalization policy indicate broadening acceptability. At the same time, substance abusers have sought similar, or more enhanced highs, through use of synthetic cannabinoids, new designer drugs with constantly changing chemical formulations that have been linked to adverse health effects and present significant challenges to public health. Submitted in response to NIDA RFA-CA-14-008 (Research Area 1), this multi-PI study builds on multidisciplinary collaboration between the researchers in the Center for Interventions, Treatment, and Addictions Research, and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing at Wright State University to develop an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, that will facilitate analysis of trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the use of cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids as discussed on Web forums and Twitter. To date, no one has developed a computer platform capable of collecting and semi-automatically analyzing data from these two complementary social media sources. We will build on the existing infrastructure developed by our interdisciplinary research team: Twitris, a robust and highly scalable platform designed to analyze Twitter data, and PREDOSE, a platform developed for our collaborative NIH grant (R21 DA030571) to analyze Web forum data on illegal buprenorphine use. Key elements of Twitris and PREDOSE will be adapted and enhanced using Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning techniques to advance the analysis of social media data for drug abuse research and is thus maximally responsive to the RFA. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop a comprehensive software platform, eDrugTrends, for semi-automated processing and visualization of thematic, sentiment, spatio-temporal, and social network dimensions of social media data (Twitter and Web forums) on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. 2) Deploy eDrugTrends to: a) Identify and compare trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use across U.S. regions with different cannabis legalization policies using Twitter and Web forum data. b) Analyze social network characteristics and identify key influencers (opinions leaders) in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid-related discussions on Twitter. The development of eDrugTrends will advance the field's technological and methodological capabilities, and our deployment of the platform will inform the field on new trends regarding the use of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs. eDrugTrends will have high public health impact by providing a tool that can be used to inform more timely interventions and policy responses to changes in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use and associated harms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration between substance abuse researchers and computer scientists, we will develop and deploy an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, to facilitate analysis of Twitter and Web forum data on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. The study will contribute to the advancement of social media surveillance methods to improve public health, and it will provide timely information on emerging trends in the context of changing cannabis laws in the U.S. that can ultimately be used to inform interventions and policy.",Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use,8913112,R01DA039454,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cannabis', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Designer Drugs', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'K2/Spice', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ohio', 'Online Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'addiction', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'meetings', 'mental state', 'multidisciplinary', 'regional difference', 'response', 'social', 'substance abuse epidemiology', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,461348,0.04066084167929753
"BIGDATA: Small DA Social Behavior Driven Modeling and Optimization of Information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Problem: Large-scale social media and social interaction data, such as tweets, blogs, discussion forums, are becoming increasing available. The patterns of information diffusion across social networks and social media are generally hidden. Modeling these historical social interactions, promises great potentials for the understanding and optimization of information diffusion in social networks. Such models also have practical impacts such as. promoting activities in health care discussion forums and accelerate the dissemination of ideas in scientific communities. However, most previous approaches for social network analysis focus on qualitative and macroscopic explanatory analysis of the network behavior, rather than quantitative and microscopic predictive models. It is difficult to make use of these models for subsequent optimization and management of information diffusion. Thus there is a great need for a robust and predictive modeling framework leveraging the large-scale historical social interaction data and can adapt to the complexity and heterogeneity of social interactions. , Aim: The goal of this project is to develop a set of robust machine learning methods for modeling and optimizing the information diffusion processes, based on the complex and noisy interaction data. It consists of a pipeline of four components: (i) develop a novel probabilistic framework for modeling and reasoning about cascades of events in social networks; (ii) develop nonparametric kernel methods to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of social interaction; (iii) develop efficient online/batch optimization algorithms fr estimating the diffusion models from large datasets; and (vi) optimize information diffusion and promote social interaction using the predictions of the estimated models. Technical Innovation and Merit: We will make novel use of event history analysis typically used for medical data analysis in the social network context. This provides us a principled and over-arching framework for addressing all four aspects in our project. The combination of event history analysis and kernel methods also reveals the connection between the information diffusion modeling problem and the grouped lasso statistical estimation problem, allowing us to bring in recently developed sparse recovery theory into social network problems such as discovery of information diffusion channels and formally study the conditions and statistical guarantees for such recovery. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Our proposed research has wide-ranging applications in health discussion forum; TuDiabetes which is operated by the Diabetes Hands Foundation will be a testbed. This project has the potential to improve the engagement of people in the discussion forum and foster better social goods for diabetes patients. The proposed research also bring together several research areas, such as event history analysis, kernel methods, graphical models, and sparsity recovery theory, to study social network problems. n/a",BIGDATA: Small DA Social Behavior Driven Modeling and Optimization of Information,8842138,R01GM108341,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Event History Analysis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Management', 'Instruction', 'Lasso', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'theories']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,205273,0.07511962426749691
"Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human interactions via internet and mobile apps are increasing and ubiquitous among all walks of life. Young and older adults are prolific in these media, as well as public and private agencies seeking to promote health behaviors and communications. Over 500 million users are registered to Twitter.com, a microblogging and social network service that conveys text messages to a restricted set of followers. Given current new user registration rates, Twitter may reach over one billion users in the next year. Over 50% of nonprofits using social media sites employ Twitter, the second highest used social media application after Facebook. Every second, 2,200 new Tweets appear offering timely broadcasts about users' current states, interests and ideas. Bigdata sources such as Twitter afford new potential in combining ""real-time"" spatial and social networking information to study causal processes underlying who, where and how individuals are connected. These key features are lacking in the traditional research designs and intervention strategies for health and health-related behaviors. For example, social network analysis (SNA), a strand of systems science, offers a unique lens to understand how human interactions through social network may collectively optimize mental health outcomes in social and geographic ""locations."" The ability to model attributes of nodes and tie strength makes SNA a powerful descriptive and predictive method. Network analyses can capture integration and fragmentation, concepts integral to prevention system planning. Indeed, novel mixed methods of SNA with machine learning can enhance prediction of flu spread in a large real-world population and future criminal incidents in a real city. The goal of this project is to develop and apply a new class of statistical and causal inference models for human interactions and their impacts on health and health-related behavioral outcomes using network data from social media sources such as Twitter.com by focusing on three research studies that integrate online social media information to understand the roles of human interaction on (a) disease spread, (b) mental health in a hard-to-reach population, and (c) presence and extent of ""natural helping"" in promoting wellness and reducing norms supporting violence in low-income urban neighborhoods. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will impact behavioral and social health sciences, including systems science communities, broadly and specifically by: (a) filling a critical gap in the literature on causal inference models for social network interactions, (b) strengthening the evidence base for how social media is used and affecting health related outcomes and behaviors, and (c) improving community capacity-building in health. n/a",Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data,8826778,R01GM108337,"['Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cities', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'State Interests', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Walking', 'behavioral outcome', 'citizen science', 'evidence base', 'flu', 'improved', 'lens', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'social', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2015,207182,0.08010082711817415
"Understanding the Mechanism of Social Network Influence in Health Outcomes throug DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in the design and implementation of the SMASH (Semantic Mining of Activity, Social, and Health data) system will address a critical need for data mining tools to help understanding the influence of healthcare social networks, such as YesiWell, on sustained weight loss where the data are multi-dimensional, temporal, semantically heterogeneous, and very sensitive. System design and implementation will rest on five specific aims. The first aim is to develop a novel data mining and statistical learning approach to understand key factors that enable spread of healthy behaviors in a social network (Aim 1). We propose to develop a formal and expressive Semantic Web ontology for the concepts used in describing the semantic features of healthcare data and social networks. We will then bridge the domain knowledge in healthcare and social networks with formal mappings across those ontological concepts (Aim 2). Next, we propose novel recommendation approaches building on top of the influence modeling and prediction. In addition, we will develop methods to utilize the recommendation as a means to better organize the social network such that the adoption of optimal health behaviors in the network can spread quickly and sustainably (Aim 3). To protect the privacy of human subjects during the data mining process for social network and health data, we consider the enforcement of differential privacy through a privacy preserving analysis layer. We will develop novel solutions to preserve differential privacy for mining dynamic health data and social activities of human subjects (Aim 4). To support this research, we will develop a web- accessible portal so that other researchers with little training i data mining will have shared access to data mining tools, ontologies, and social network analysis results (Aim 5). At the end of this project, data resources, tools, ontologies, and technologies will be made available to the larger research community. This work is an inter-disciplinary collaboration among the PI, Dejing Dou, Co-I Daniel Lowd, both experts in data mining and machine learning, and Jessica Greene, an expert in health policy, at the University of Oregon, Brigitte Piniewski MD, the lead of YesiWell, at PeaceHealth Laboratories, Ruoming Jin, an expert in complex network mining, at Kent State University, Xintao Wu, an expert in privacy preserving mining, at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, David Kil, the previous Chief Scientist at SKT Americas and program manager of YesiWell, and the founder of HealthMantic, and Junfeng Sun, a mathematical statistician at the NIH and an expert in design of clinical trials.

"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,8821669,R21MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R21,2015,225262,-0.028890144592832102
"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8930929,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,428238,0.02995446423893341
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18-20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long-term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components - the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of thes services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In our recenly completed Phase I STTR, we developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. Our VE, known as Pegasys-VR"", allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in-clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at-home solution). Our results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET-C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, our Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in-clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in-vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys-VR"" is as effective as traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow-up.

Its use for the treatment of social skills deficits will offer a superior soluton for mental health personnel, solving many of the resource and logistic barriers that they currently face. The final product will address cost and practical issues by disseminating an empirically-supported treatment that was rigorously built and tested.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.                ",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,8814777,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'motivational processes', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2015,561912,0.017536829533930924
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,0.0171240647074276
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8897409,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,521457,0.04158300877845492
"The Development and neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.",Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders,8847802,K01MH094689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Encapsulated', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gur', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ruthenium Ben', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Structure of middle temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'auditory pathway', 'career', 'developmental disease', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'language processing', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2015,168157,0.009210039510494771
"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses challenges that social media data pose for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies.

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8892807,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serotonergic System', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2015,56042,0.011721381548279931
"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving - Supplement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult.

"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.            ",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8772435,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,194915,0.018910113232108325
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.          The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.

"Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis remains one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the U.S., and current changes in legalization policy indicate broadening acceptability. At the same time, substance abusers have sought similar, or more enhanced highs, through use of synthetic cannabinoids, new designer drugs with constantly changing chemical formulations that have been linked to adverse health effects and present significant challenges to public health. Submitted in response to NIDA RFA-CA-14-008 (Research Area 1), this multi-PI study builds on multidisciplinary collaboration between the researchers in the Center for Interventions, Treatment, and Addictions Research, and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing at Wright State University to develop an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, that will facilitate analysis of trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the use of cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids as discussed on Web forums and Twitter. To date, no one has developed a computer platform capable of collecting and semi-automatically analyzing data from these two complementary social media sources. We will build on the existing infrastructure developed by our interdisciplinary research team: Twitris, a robust and highly scalable platform designed to analyze Twitter data, and PREDOSE, a platform developed for our collaborative NIH grant (R21 DA030571) to analyze Web forum data on illegal buprenorphine use. Key elements of Twitris and PREDOSE will be adapted and enhanced using Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning techniques to advance the analysis of social media data for drug abuse research and is thus maximally responsive to the RFA. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop a comprehensive software platform, eDrugTrends, for semi-automated processing and visualization of thematic, sentiment, spatio-temporal, and social network dimensions of social media data (Twitter and Web forums) on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. 2) Deploy eDrugTrends to: a) Identify and compare trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use across U.S. regions with different cannabis legalization policies using Twitter and Web forum data. b) Analyze social network characteristics and identify key influencers (opinions leaders) in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid-related discussions on Twitter. The development of eDrugTrends will advance the field's technological and methodological capabilities, and our deployment of the platform will inform the field on new trends regarding the use of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs. eDrugTrends will have high public health impact by providing a tool that can be used to inform more timely interventions and policy responses to changes in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use and associated harms.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration between substance abuse researchers and computer scientists, we will develop and deploy an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, to facilitate analysis of Twitter and Web forum data on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. The study will contribute to the advancement of social media surveillance methods to improve public health, and it will provide timely information on emerging trends in the context of changing cannabis laws in the U.S. that can ultimately be used to inform interventions and policy.            ",Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use,8827089,R01DA039454,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Designer Drugs', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ohio', 'Online Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Spices', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'addiction', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental state', 'multidisciplinary', 'public health relevance', 'regional difference', 'response', 'social', 'substance abuse epidemiology', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,506725,0.04066084167929753
"BIGDATA: Small DA Social Behavior Driven Modeling and Optimization of Information     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Problem: Large-scale social media and social interaction data, such as tweets, blogs, discussion forums, are becoming increasing available. The patterns of information diffusion across social networks and social media are generally hidden. Modeling these historical social interactions, promises great potentials for the understanding and optimization of information diffusion in social networks. Such models also have practical impacts such as. promoting activities in health care discussion forums and accelerate the dissemination of ideas in scientific communities. However, most previous approaches for social network analysis focus on qualitative and macroscopic explanatory analysis of the network behavior, rather than quantitative and microscopic predictive models. It is difficult to make use of these models for subsequent optimization and management of information diffusion. Thus there is a great need for a robust and predictive modeling framework leveraging the large-scale historical social interaction data and can adapt to the complexity and heterogeneity of social interactions. , Aim: The goal of this project is to develop a set of robust machine learning methods for modeling and optimizing the information diffusion processes, based on the complex and noisy interaction data. It consists of a pipeline of four components: (i) develop a novel probabilistic framework for modeling and reasoning about cascades of events in social networks; (ii) develop nonparametric kernel methods to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of social interaction; (iii) develop efficient online/batch optimization algorithms fr estimating the diffusion models from large datasets; and (vi) optimize information diffusion and promote social interaction using the predictions of the estimated models. Technical Innovation and Merit: We will make novel use of event history analysis typically used for medical data analysis in the social network context. This provides us a principled and over-arching framework for addressing all four aspects in our project. The combination of event history analysis and kernel methods also reveals the connection between the information diffusion modeling problem and the grouped lasso statistical estimation problem, allowing us to bring in recently developed sparse recovery theory into social network problems such as discovery of information diffusion channels and formally study the conditions and statistical guarantees for such recovery. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Our proposed research has wide-ranging applications in health discussion forum; TuDiabetes which is operated by the Diabetes Hands Foundation will be a testbed. This project has the potential to improve the engagement of people in the discussion forum and foster better social goods for diabetes patients. The proposed research also bring together several research areas, such as event history analysis, kernel methods, graphical models, and sparsity recovery theory, to study social network problems.              n/a",BIGDATA: Small DA Social Behavior Driven Modeling and Optimization of Information,8695416,R01GM108341,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Event History Analysis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Management', 'Instruction', 'Lasso', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'theories']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,205273,0.07511962426749691
"Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human interactions via internet and mobile apps are increasing and ubiquitous among all walks of life. Young and older adults are prolific in these media, as well as public and private agencies seeking to promote health behaviors and communications. Over 500 million users are registered to Twitter.com, a microblogging and social network service that conveys text messages to a restricted set of followers. Given current new user registration rates, Twitter may reach over one billion users in the next year. Over 50% of nonprofits using social media sites employ Twitter, the second highest used social media application after Facebook. Every second, 2,200 new Tweets appear offering timely broadcasts about users' current states, interests and ideas. Bigdata sources such as Twitter afford new potential in combining ""real-time"" spatial and social networking information to study causal processes underlying who, where and how individuals are connected. These key features are lacking in the traditional research designs and intervention strategies for health and health-related behaviors. For example, social network analysis (SNA), a strand of systems science, offers a unique lens to understand how human interactions through social network may collectively optimize mental health outcomes in social and geographic ""locations."" The ability to model attributes of nodes and tie strength makes SNA a powerful descriptive and predictive method. Network analyses can capture integration and fragmentation, concepts integral to prevention system planning. Indeed, novel mixed methods of SNA with machine learning can enhance prediction of flu spread in a large real-world population and future criminal incidents in a real city. The goal of this project is to develop and apply a new class of statistical and causal inference models for human interactions and their impacts on health and health-related behavioral outcomes using network data from social media sources such as Twitter.com by focusing on three research studies that integrate online social media information to understand the roles of human interaction on (a) disease spread, (b) mental health in a hard-to-reach population, and (c) presence and extent of ""natural helping"" in promoting wellness and reducing norms supporting violence in low-income urban neighborhoods. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will impact behavioral and social health sciences, including systems science communities, broadly and specifically by: (a) filling a critical gap in the literature on causal inference models for social network interactions, (b) strengthening the evidence base for how social media is used and affecting health related outcomes and behaviors, and (c) improving community capacity-building in health.              n/a",Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data,8692958,R01GM108337,"['Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cities', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'State Interests', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Walking', 'evidence base', 'flu', 'improved', 'lens', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'social', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2014,208564,0.08010082711817415
"Multivariate Representations of Emotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of affective neuroscience is to understand the brain systems and mechanisms underlying the evaluation, experience, and expression of emotion. For example, a widely studied and hotly debated issue in the field is the manner in which biophysical responses to emotional stimuli can be characterized, whether by distinct categories or alternatively along dimensions of valence and arousal. Advances in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science have fostered significant progress in identifying brain regions involved in processing emotion generally; however, consistent and specific neural markers for distinct affective states have yet to be found. This proposal uses a cutting-edge approach to this core, unresolved question in the field by harnessing emerging pattern classification techniques that are capable of detecting subtle yet coordinated signals from an array of sources. The overarching goal is to identify multivariate patterns of behavioral and biological responding to specific affective states and determine whether these states are organized according to categorical or dimensional architectures. By combining psychophysiology (Aim 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), these studies will examine how humans respond to emotional stimuli that vary in duration, modality, and categorical nature. Study 1 focuses on distinct emotions elicited by instrumental music and movie clips whereas Study 2 focuses on those elicited by facial and vocal affect. Together, the aims will provide an integrative, computationally-rigorous method to identify biomarkers of specific emotions that are typically overlooked by conventional univariate statistical approaches. Applying machine learning algorithms in this innovative way could be fruitful for identifying how emotional representations are altered in affective disorders, with the potential for developing novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, identifying patterns of overlap between specific emotion categories may further aid efforts to understand comorbidity issues in anxiety and mood disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify patterns of brain and bodily responses that are representative of unique emotional states, using analytical methods that examine changes in multiple biological signals in concert. Identifying neural and peripheral representations of emotional states and how they relate to self-reports of emotion will provide a better understanding of how emotions are organized and coded in the brain and body. These biomarkers of specific emotions can provide clues as to how emotional processing is altered in mood and anxiety disorders and can lead to novel treatment targets.                    ",Multivariate Representations of Emotion,8685333,R21MH098149,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Music', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'emotional experience', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,235500,0.027476517859250715
"Understanding the Mechanism of Social Network Influence in Health Outcomes throug     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in the design and implementation of the SMASH (Semantic Mining of Activity, Social, and Health data) system will address a critical need for data mining tools to help understanding the influence of healthcare social networks, such as YesiWell, on sustained weight loss where the data are multi-dimensional, temporal, semantically heterogeneous, and very sensitive. System design and implementation will rest on five specific aims. The first aim is to develop a novel data mining and statistical learning approach to understand key factors that enable spread of healthy behaviors in a social network (Aim 1). We propose to develop a formal and expressive Semantic Web ontology for the concepts used in describing the semantic features of healthcare data and social networks. We will then bridge the domain knowledge in healthcare and social networks with formal mappings across those ontological concepts (Aim 2). Next, we propose novel recommendation approaches building on top of the influence modeling and prediction. In addition, we will develop methods to utilize the recommendation as a means to better organize the social network such that the adoption of optimal health behaviors in the network can spread quickly and sustainably (Aim 3). To protect the privacy of human subjects during the data mining process for social network and health data, we consider the enforcement of differential privacy through a privacy preserving analysis layer. We will develop novel solutions to preserve differential privacy for mining dynamic health data and social activities of human subjects (Aim 4). To support this research, we will develop a web- accessible portal so that other researchers with little training i data mining will have shared access to data mining tools, ontologies, and social network analysis results (Aim 5). At the end of this project, data resources, tools, ontologies, and technologies will be made available to the larger research community.

"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.                ",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,8635153,R21MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R21,2014,269650,-0.028890144592832102
"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.                ",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8693710,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,504210,0.02995446423893341
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.

"Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18-20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long-term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components - the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of thes services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In our recenly completed Phase I STTR, we developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. Our VE, known as Pegasys-VR"", allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in-clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at-home solution). Our results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET-C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, our Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in-clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in-vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys-VR"" is as effective as traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow-up. If Pegasys-VR"" is clinically efficacious, it would offer a sustainable, cost-effective intervention that can be easily and rapidy disseminated.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among children, social anxiety is a common, severe and chronic disorder. Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) is an empirically supported treatment with significant potential to impact the lives of children with this severe and chronic disorder. The proposed Pegasys-VR"" system will distinctly enhance its utility, as it will allow dissemination to a broad variety of clinical settings including schools as well as traditional outpatient clinics. Its use for the treatment of social skills deficits will offer a superior soluton for mental health personnel, solving many of the resource and logistic barriers that they currently face. The final product will address cost and practical issues by disseminating an empirically-supported treatment that was rigorously built and tested. Using VE will make the traditional social skills therapy programs program cost-effective and patient-centric, allowing even clinicians with little background/training in behavior therapy to have tools not typically availabl to them.            ",Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety,8780982,R42MH094019,"['Academic achievement', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fluoxetine', 'Game Theory', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Logistics', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevalence', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Relaxation Therapy', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Roche brand of peginterferon alfa-2a', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Impacts', 'Solutions', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Youth', 'aged', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mental health personnel', 'natural language', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'pill', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'virtual', 'virtual human']",NIMH,"VIRTUALLY BETTER, INC.",R42,2014,693414,0.03873034520467146
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8782905,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2014,53282,0.011721381548279931
"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult. Given observed relations between craving and smoking relapse, novel approaches to craving relief are sorely needed. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings, setting the stage fr future research testing its value as a component of a smoking cessation intervention.            ",An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving,8685449,R01CA184779,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coping Skills', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Familiarity', 'Gender', 'Habits', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personality', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Smell Perception', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Vision research', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'coping', 'craving', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nicotine patch', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'olfactory stimulus', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'theories']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,301587,0.03488477937229211
"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion  Project Summary Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that the recognition of facial expressions of emotion is partially accomplished by an analysis of configural features. Configural cues are known to play an important role in other face recognition tasks, but their role in the processing of expressions of emotion is not yet well understood. Aim 2 will identify a number of these configural cues. We will use real images of faces, manipulated versions of these face images, and schematic drawings. It is also known that shape features play a role in facial expressions (e.g., the curvature of the mouth in happiness). In Aim 3, we define a shape-based computational model. Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.  Project Narrative Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease. Also, abused children are more acute at recognizing emotions, suggesting a higher degree of expertise to some image features. Identifying which features are used by the cognitive system will help develop protocols for reducing their unwanted effects. Understanding the limits in spatial and time resolution will also be important for studies of low vision (acuity), which are typical problems in several eye diseases and in the normal process of aging.",A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion,8669977,R01EY020834,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Anger', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Child Abuse', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computer human interaction', 'computer studies', 'court', 'design', 'human subject', 'millisecond', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'showing emotion', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,358680,0.05118489896257606
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.          The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.

"BIGDATA: Small DA Social Behavior Driven Modeling and Optimization of Information     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Problem: Large-scale social media and social interaction data, such as tweets, blogs, discussion forums, are becoming increasing available. The patterns of information diffusion across social networks and social media are generally hidden. Modeling these historical social interactions, promises great potentials for the understanding and optimization of information diffusion in social networks. Such models also have practical impacts such as. promoting activities in health care discussion forums and accelerate the dissemination of ideas in scientific communities. However, most previous approaches for social network analysis focus on qualitative and macroscopic explanatory analysis of the network behavior, rather than quantitative and microscopic predictive models. It is difficult to make use of these models for subsequent optimization and management of information diffusion. Thus there is a great need for a robust and predictive modeling framework leveraging the large-scale historical social interaction data and can adapt to the complexity and heterogeneity of social interactions. , Aim: The goal of this project is to develop a set of robust machine learning methods for modeling and optimizing the information diffusion processes, based on the complex and noisy interaction data. It consists of a pipeline of four components: (i) develop a novel probabilistic framework for modeling and reasoning about cascades of events in social networks; (ii) develop nonparametric kernel methods to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of social interaction; (iii) develop efficient online/batch optimization algorithms fr estimating the diffusion models from large datasets; and (vi) optimize information diffusion and promote social interaction using the predictions of the estimated models. Technical Innovation and Merit: We will make novel use of event history analysis typically used for medical data analysis in the social network context. This provides us a principled and over-arching framework for addressing all four aspects in our project. The combination of event history analysis and kernel methods also reveals the connection between the information diffusion modeling problem and the grouped lasso statistical estimation problem, allowing us to bring in recently developed sparse recovery theory into social network problems such as discovery of information diffusion channels and formally study the conditions and statistical guarantees for such recovery. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Our proposed research has wide-ranging applications in health discussion forum; TuDiabetes which is operated by the Diabetes Hands Foundation will be a testbed. This project has the potential to improve the engagement of people in the discussion forum and foster better social goods for diabetes patients. The proposed research also bring together several research areas, such as event history analysis, kernel methods, graphical models, and sparsity recovery theory, to study social network problems.              n/a",BIGDATA: Small DA Social Behavior Driven Modeling and Optimization of Information,8599819,R01GM108341,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Event History Analysis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Management', 'Instruction', 'Lasso', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'theories']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2013,125000,0.07511962426749691
"Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human interactions via internet and mobile apps are increasing and ubiquitous among all walks of life. Young and older adults are prolific in these media, as well as public and private agencies seeking to promote health behaviors and communications. Over 500 million users are registered to Twitter.com, a microblogging and social network service that conveys text messages to a restricted set of followers. Given current new user registration rates, Twitter may reach over one billion users in the next year. Over 50% of nonprofits using social media sites employ Twitter, the second highest used social media application after Facebook. Every second, 2,200 new Tweets appear offering timely broadcasts about users' current states, interests and ideas. Bigdata sources such as Twitter afford new potential in combining ""real-time"" spatial and social networking information to study causal processes underlying who, where and how individuals are connected. These key features are lacking in the traditional research designs and intervention strategies for health and health-related behaviors. For example, social network analysis (SNA), a strand of systems science, offers a unique lens to understand how human interactions through social network may collectively optimize mental health outcomes in social and geographic ""locations."" The ability to model attributes of nodes and tie strength makes SNA a powerful descriptive and predictive method. Network analyses can capture integration and fragmentation, concepts integral to prevention system planning. Indeed, novel mixed methods of SNA with machine learning can enhance prediction of flu spread in a large real-world population and future criminal incidents in a real city. The goal of this project is to develop and apply a new class of statistical and causal inference models for human interactions and their impacts on health and health-related behavioral outcomes using network data from social media sources such as Twitter.com by focusing on three research studies that integrate online social media information to understand the roles of human interaction on (a) disease spread, (b) mental health in a hard-to-reach population, and (c) presence and extent of ""natural helping"" in promoting wellness and reducing norms supporting violence in low-income urban neighborhoods. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will impact behavioral and social health sciences, including systems science communities, broadly and specifically by: (a) filling a critical gap in the literature on causal inference models for social network interactions, (b) strengthening the evidence base for how social media is used and affecting health related outcomes and behaviors, and (c) improving community capacity-building in health.              n/a",Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data,8600055,R01GM108337,"['Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cities', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'State Interests', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Walking', 'evidence base', 'flu', 'improved', 'lens', 'novel', 'research study', 'social', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2013,125000,0.08010082711817415
"Multivariate Representations of Emotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of affective neuroscience is to understand the brain systems and mechanisms underlying the evaluation, experience, and expression of emotion. For example, a widely studied and hotly debated issue in the field is the manner in which biophysical responses to emotional stimuli can be characterized, whether by distinct categories or alternatively along dimensions of valence and arousal. Advances in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science have fostered significant progress in identifying brain regions involved in processing emotion generally; however, consistent and specific neural markers for distinct affective states have yet to be found. This proposal uses a cutting-edge approach to this core, unresolved question in the field by harnessing emerging pattern classification techniques that are capable of detecting subtle yet coordinated signals from an array of sources. The overarching goal is to identify multivariate patterns of behavioral and biological responding to specific affective states and determine whether these states are organized according to categorical or dimensional architectures. By combining psychophysiology (Aim 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), these studies will examine how humans respond to emotional stimuli that vary in duration, modality, and categorical nature. Study 1 focuses on distinct emotions elicited by instrumental music and movie clips whereas Study 2 focuses on those elicited by facial and vocal affect. Together, the aims will provide an integrative, computationally-rigorous method to identify biomarkers of specific emotions that are typically overlooked by conventional univariate statistical approaches. Applying machine learning algorithms in this innovative way could be fruitful for identifying how emotional representations are altered in affective disorders, with the potential for developing novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, identifying patterns of overlap between specific emotion categories may further aid efforts to understand comorbidity issues in anxiety and mood disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify patterns of brain and bodily responses that are representative of unique emotional states, using analytical methods that examine changes in multiple biological signals in concert. Identifying neural and peripheral representations of emotional states and how they relate to self-reports of emotion will provide a better understanding of how emotions are organized and coded in the brain and body. These biomarkers of specific emotions can provide clues as to how emotional processing is altered in mood and anxiety disorders and can lead to novel treatment targets.                    ",Multivariate Representations of Emotion,8510264,R21MH098149,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Music', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'emotional experience', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,196250,0.027476517859250715
"Understanding the Mechanism of Social Network Influence in Health Outcomes throug     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in the design and implementation of the SMASH (Semantic Mining of Activity, Social, and Health data) system will address a critical need for data mining tools to help understanding the influence of healthcare social networks, such as YesiWell, on sustained weight loss where the data are multi-dimensional, temporal, semantically heterogeneous, and very sensitive. System design and implementation will rest on five specific aims. The first aim is to develop a novel data mining and statistical learning approach to understand key factors that enable spread of healthy behaviors in a social network (Aim 1). We propose to develop a formal and expressive Semantic Web ontology for the concepts used in describing the semantic features of healthcare data and social networks. We will then bridge the domain knowledge in healthcare and social networks with formal mappings across those ontological concepts (Aim 2). Next, we propose novel recommendation approaches building on top of the influence modeling and prediction. In addition, we will develop methods to utilize the recommendation as a means to better organize the social network such that the adoption of optimal health behaviors in the network can spread quickly and sustainably (Aim 3). To protect the privacy of human subjects during the data mining process for social network and health data, we consider the enforcement of differential privacy through a privacy preserving analysis layer. We will develop novel solutions to preserve differential privacy for mining dynamic health data and social activities of human subjects (Aim 4). To support this research, we will develop a web- accessible portal so that other researchers with little training i data mining will have shared access to data mining tools, ontologies, and social network analysis results (Aim 5). At the end of this project, data resources, tools, ontologies, and technologies will be made available to the larger research community.

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.                ",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,8573671,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,627944,0.0064074505183525435
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.                ",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8452565,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2013,571955,0.04158300877845492
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments.

"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion  Project Summary Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that the recognition of facial expressions of emotion is partially accomplished by an analysis of configural features. Configural cues are known to play an important role in other face recognition tasks, but their role in the processing of expressions of emotion is not yet well understood. Aim 2 will identify a number of these configural cues. We will use real images of faces, manipulated versions of these face images, and schematic drawings. It is also known that shape features play a role in facial expressions (e.g., the curvature of the mouth in happiness). In Aim 3, we define a shape-based computational model. Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.  Project Narrative Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease. Also, abused children are more acute at recognizing emotions, suggesting a higher degree of expertise to some image features. Identifying which features are used by the cognitive system will help develop protocols for reducing their unwanted effects. Understanding the limits in spatial and time resolution will also be important for studies of low vision (acuity), which are typical problems in several eye diseases and in the normal process of aging.",A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion,8494053,R01EY020834,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Anger', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Child Abuse', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computer human interaction', 'computer studies', 'court', 'design', 'human subject', 'millisecond', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'showing emotion', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,347700,0.05118489896257606
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.              The project has two target application domains.

"Pattern Analysis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in SAD The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool. We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b). Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD. We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD.

Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.  Project Narrative Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease. Also, abused children are more acute at recognizing emotions, suggesting a higher degree of expertise to some image features. Identifying which features are used by the cognitive system will help develop protocols for reducing their unwanted effects. Understanding the limits in spatial and time resolution will also be important for studies of low vision (acuity), which are typical problems in several eye diseases and in the normal process of aging.",A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion,8266468,R01EY020834,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Anger', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Child Abuse', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computer human interaction', 'computer studies', 'court', 'design', 'human subject', 'millisecond', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'showing emotion', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,366000,0.05118489896257606
"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Pattern analysis of large-scale functional connectivity to predict implicit emoti The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed:    Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool.    We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b).    Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD.    We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD. This would contribute to our understanding of and aid in the development of therapies for these distinct anxiety disorders.",Pattern analysis of large-scale functional connectivity to predict implicit emoti,8089245,F31MH088104,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Panic Disorder', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Social Controls', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical application', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'therapy development', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2011,37400,0.015597637220880046
"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.              Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness.

"Biological and Information Processing Mechanisms Underlying Autism This center focuses on elucidating fundamental information processing and neurobiological mechanisms causing autism. It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism.

Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion. Genetic modifiers of emotionality will also be determined. Project III focuses on understanding disturbances in functional brain connectivity that underlie the impaired processing of information and in turn the cognitive and behavioral impairments in autism. The project also includes innovative machine-learning studies of how the brain identifies and categorizes words and computational modeling of cortical function. Project IV looks at structural connectivity of specific white matter pathways and the histopathology of intra-cortical white matter projections. This project will help reconcile the functional under-connectivity and early structural overgrowth in autism.

These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed.

"Biological and Information Processing Mechanisms Underlying Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This center focuses on elucidating fundamental information processing and neurobiological mechanisms causing autism. It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism.

Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion. Genetic modifiers of emotionality will also be determined. Project III focuses on understanding disturbances in functional brain connectivity that underlie the impaired processing of information and in turn the cognitive and behavioral impairments in autism. The project also includes innovative machine-learning studies of how the brain identifies and categorizes words and computational modeling of cortical function. Project IV looks at structural connectivity of specific white matter pathways and the histopathology of intra-cortical white matter projections. This project will help reconcile the functional under-connectivity and early structural overgrowth in autism. The identification of fundamental information processing mechanisms underlying the behavior of autism will lead to the development of more specific and effective interventions; similarly identification of connectivity alterations can lead to targeted cognitive interventions that increase neural connectivity.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare.

"Extending Social Skills Training for Children Through Interactive Technology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of research indicate social-behavioral deficits negatively affect adjustment and place children at increased risk for a myriad of later negative outcomes including depression, substance abuse, and delinquency. Without intervention, social-behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in turn, has a tremendous impact on mental health. Social skills training (SST) is supported as an efficacious method for significantly improving children's peer relations, social behavior, and emotional adjustment and reducing risk of developmental psychopathology. Further, the efficacy of SST interventions is enhanced when training extends outside a treatment setting with practice opportunities. The goal of this one-year SBIR Phase I project is to extend an existing evidence-based small group SST program for children (SSGRIN; Social Skills Group Intervention) into the home environment through a computer-based interactive social training system (ISTS). The proposed ISTS will offer tailored interactive social problem-solving exercises that parallel SSGRIN's in-person intervention. A unique multi- disciplinary collaboration between computer science and psychology will guide development. For the Phase I prototype, the software user-interface, including graphic design, as well as modes of user interaction, story plot and sequence, and hierarchy of causal relations will be developed. Development will build on 3-C's existing work on pedagogical agents in social stories and animation for SST. Via the ISTS, children will actively solve plot-based social problems by interacting with pedagogical agents, purposefully using SSGRIN skills and concepts to navigate the story events. The interactivity of the proposed ISTS will be a significant technological advancement over current SST software enabling story events to be scaffolded based on child's actions and goals. In addition, the proposed ISTS will have a reporting feature built into the software to provide intervention providers with feedback regarding children's interactions with the ISTS to inform their in-person SST efforts. Once the software prototype is created, an initial test of feasibility will be conducted within two target market segments (school- and community-based child mental health professionals; n=30 each) and with targeted end users (children ages 8-12 years and parents; n=30 each) to determine the usability, feasibility, and value of the proposed product. Phase I findings will provide the foundation for the development and testing of the complete SSGRIN-ISTS product during Phase II. Once the ISTS is finalized, a scientific evaluation will be conducted in Phase II to examine whether inclusion of the ISTS results in enhanced treatment benefits for children's social skills, behavior, and mental health, greater generalization of skill acquisition, and higher engagement in treatment compared with SSGRIN alone. The long-term objective of this product is to decrease the development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits. This project addresses the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) calls for early treatment of children who experience mental health to offset potential co-occurring disorders, school failure, and other problems. Problematic peer relations, particularly when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's mental health as well as their academic, behavioral, and emotional functioning. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in turn, has a tremendous impact on the development of psychopathology. Development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits is a public health concern with annual US economic, indirect cost of mental illnesses estimated at $79 billion. Cost-effectiveness analyses of social skills training programs with even modest effect sizes estimated a monetary savings of more than $95,000 per participant and more than $8 return on every dollar invested. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) specifically calls for the identification and early treatment of children who experience mental health needs in order to prevent the potential onset of co-occurring disorders and break a cycle that otherwise can lead to school failure and other problems.          n/a",Extending Social Skills Training for Children Through Interactive Technology,7326354,R43MH081385,"['12 year old', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Mental Health', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Economics', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Marketing', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Price', 'Problem Solving', 'Problem behavior', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Schools', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Problems', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Writing', 'animation', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'emotional adjustment', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'peer', 'posters', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'provider intervention', 'size', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social skills', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'trial comparing', 'usability']",NIMH,3-C INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT,R43,2007,240453,0.02269063683916111

"Facial Expression Analysis by Image Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression provides cues about emotional response, regulates interpersonal behavior, and communicates aspects of psychopathology. Human-observer based methods for measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to standardize. Our interdisciplinary team of computer and behavioral scientists has developed the CMU/Pitt Automated Facial Image Analysis (AFA) system that is capable of automatically recognizing facial action units and analyzing their timing in facial behavior. The quantitative measurement achieved by AFA represents a major advance over manual and subjective measurement without requiring the use of invasive sensors. We envision to use AFA's reliable, valid, and efficient measurement of emotion expression and related nonverbal behavior for assessment of symptom severity in depression. Current methods of clinical assessment of depression depend almost entirely on verbal report (clinical interview and/or questionnaire). They lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are .strong indicators of depressive symptoms, especially those related to the timing of dyadic interaction between clinician and patient, much of which may occur outside the awareness of either individual. AFA is capable of extracting both the type and timing of nonverbal indicators of depression. Our hypothesis is that quantitative measures of the configuration and timing of facial expression, head motion, and gaze obtainable by AFA will improve clinical assessment of symptom severity and evaluation of treatment outcomes when combined with information from interviews and self-report questionnaires. We propose to test this hypothesis in 40 participants participating in a treatment intervention study for major depression. Interview, questionnaire, and video data will be collected at regular intervals over the course of treatment. To measure social dynamics, both patient and interviewer will be video recorded and processed using AFA. Longitudinal multilevel modeling will be used to test study hypotheses. We will improve further algorithms and capabilities of AFA to meet evaluation goals and prepare AFA for use by the scientific and clinical community.         n/a",Facial Expression Analysis by Image Processing,7049026,R01MH051435,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'emotions', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'interpersonal relations', 'statistics /biometry', 'videotape /videodisc', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2006,480876,0.05290405881374481
"FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): Facial expression provides       sensitive cues about emotional response and plays a critical role in the             regulation of interpersonal behavior. Human-observer based methods for               measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to       standardize across laboratories and over time. To make feasible more rigorous,       quantitative measurement of facial expression in diverse applications, the           investigators formed an interdisciplinary research group that covers expertise       in facial expression analysis and computer vision. In August 1995, the research      group received initial funding for Facial Expression Analysis by Computer Image      Processing (NIMH #IRO1MH51435). With NIMH support, they created a large              representative database for method development and developed and validated a         face analysis system that tracks gaze and facial features in digitized image         sequences of infant, child, and adult subjects. In near frontal views, the Face      Analysis System has achieved concurrent validity with manual FACS coding for 16      of 44 FAGS action units and more than 30 combinations in which they occur. For       the competing renewal, the investigators will (1) Increase system robustness to      head orientation and head motion (2) Increase the number of recognizable action      units to include all 30 of those that have a specific anatomic basis, and (3)        Conduct a systematic, large-scale, comprehensive test of the developed Face          Analysis System by using multiple databases. These databases encompass subjects      of various ages and backgrounds and varying types of emotion induction, head         orientation, head motion, size of the face in pixels, and presence of speech.        The databases were initially collected to answer substantive questions about         emotion processes; they represent the types of data that the Face Analysis           System will encounter in psychology research and clinical applications. n/a",FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING,6881434,R01MH051435,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'emotions', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'interpersonal relations', 'statistics /biometry', 'videotape /videodisc', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2005,358843,0.066808117361516

These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals.

"Self and Consciousness: Roots of Humanity?   DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): This is a proposal for a two-day             symposium and associated book entitled, ""Self and Consciousness: Roots of             Humanity?"" The purpose of the conference is to elucidate the many ways in which      self and consciousness interrelate. This will lead to substantial increases in       the understanding of both self and identity (by identifying the ways in which        personal and social self-definition depend on consciousness, and under what          conditions, and with what effects, consciousness gives rise to                       self-consciousness) and consciousness (by specifying the diverse ways in which       self and identity are implicated in the many facets of consciousness). The           concepts of self/identity and consciousness each have recently come to the fore      in the social and behavioral sciences. However, the ways in which these              multidimensional constructs are connected has received limited attention.            Further, existing work on self and consciousness is piecemeal and fragmented,        spread across a wide range of topics and studied by scholars from diverse            disciplines. The symposium will identify, organize, and prioritize a set of          theoretical questions, investigative approaches, and empirical findings              pertaining to the role of self and identity as antecedents, accompaniments, and      consequences of consciousness. In doing so, the conference/book will set an          agenda for future research in this area and point toward prevention and              treatment strategies for mental illnesses involving disturbances of self and/or      consciousness. The symposium will be structured as follows: (1) Where we came        from - Self and consciousness in ""prehuman"" species (are humans really               unique?) and through human history (is there something special about modern          self and consciousness?); (2) Where we are now: Humans as biological beasts and      cognitive creatures - The brain and mind as biological and cognitive systems         underlying self and consciousness; (3) Where we are now: Humans as social            beings-The social underpinnings of self and consciousness, including how self        and consciousness emerge in face-to-face interactions over the course of             development and how societal belief systems impact (and often disturb) the self      and consciousness of individuals; (4) Where we might go - Where humans will          likely go in the future, including how human selves and consciousness might be       changed by interacting with computers and related electronic media and the           possibility of the construction of ""conscious computers with selves."" Each           topic will be addressed by two speakers followed by a discussant. An edited          volume based on the conference will be published by Oxford University Press.         This book will not be a simple proceedings collection. The editor and an             independent referee will read each paper. The editor will synthesize the             critiques and send them to each author, who will then revise his/her contribution.  In addition, the associated published book will have an introductory chapter that  describes the volume's themes and organization, and a concluding chapter that  summarizes the chapters and highlights emergent issues. n/a",Self and Consciousness: Roots of Humanity?,6416745,R13MH064642,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' books', ' cognition', ' computer human interaction', ' consciousness', ' evolution', ' identity', ' interpersonal relations', ' meeting /conference /symposium', ' psychological identification', ' social psychology', ' travel']",NIMH,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R13,2002,24550,0.017837438042567016

"COMPUTER VISION ANALYSIS OF DYNAMIC FACIAL BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Facial expressions provide an important behavioral measure for the study of emotion, cognitive processes, and social interaction, and contain diagnostic information for neurological disorders and depression.

The measurement is presently performed by human experts. The goal of this research is to develop an automatic system for recognition, measurement, and coding of facial expressions from video using computer vision technology. This project will utilize probabilistic models of dynamical systems to mod& the facial behavior underlying the observed image sequences. These techniques include hidden Markov models, and a new stochastic modeling technique developed by Movellan and colleagues called diffusion networks [38].

"FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING DESCRIPTION (Applicant's Abstract):  Facial expression communicates              information about emotional response and plays a critical role in the            regulation of interpersonal behavior.  Current human-observer based methods      for measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and            difficult to standardize across laboratories and over time.  To make             feasible more rigorous, quantitative measurement of facial expression in         diverse applications, we formed an interdisciplinary research group which        covers expertise in facial expression analysis and image processing.  In the     funding period, we developed and demonstrated the first version of an            automated system for measuring facial expression in digitized images.  The       system can discriminate nine combinations of FACS action units in the upper      and lower face, quantity the timing and topography of action unit intensity      in the brow region; and geometrically normalize image sequences within a         range of plus or minus 20 degrees of out of-plane.

"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9936445,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664314,0.007257556153374969
"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,9933852,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'social observations', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,332269,0.022256955779170574
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,9946780,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,150000,0.045301274134211096
"Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period, social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach, integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~ 2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye- tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use. Project Narrative Nearly all adolescents use social media sites, yet for a vulnerable subset of teens, social media use may increase risk for suicide. Given rising suicide rates among adolescent girls in recent years, it is critical to examine the reasons why social media use may be related to suicidal thoughts and attempts. Findings of this study will have the potential to inform future suicide intervention and prevention efforts that address the unique needs of adolescents in the digital age.",Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents,9951503,K23MH122669,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Psychiatry', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Disclosure', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Twitter', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'girls', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social norm', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'therapy development', 'visual tracking', 'web interface']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K23,2020,195616,0.0491599268413445
"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram. This will be accomplished using an innovative methodology involving advanced machine learning, statistical, geospatial and network analysis.",Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution,9951970,R21DA050689,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communications Media', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vendor', 'Youth', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient advocacy group', 'peer influence', 'prescription drug abuse', 'response', 'service providers', 'social media', 'study population', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2020,236250,0.04221004823726137
"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,9993553,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2020,441529,0.013230599548052849
"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.  The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression.

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9912818,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,581743,0.03868427840715989
"An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support ABSTRACT Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes, clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources. We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in 44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006- 2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR- SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis, informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2). We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR- based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support- cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities. NARRATIVE Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes and is critical to racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes.

"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10041744,K99MH124435,"['Affect', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'mind control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'recruit', 'redshift', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'social competition', 'social deficits', 'social interventions', 'social neuroscience', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2020,123390,0.06904795791137955
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9995592,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'social structure', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,211875,0.08180395682252387
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups Intricate social hierarchies that go through both dynamic and stable phases exist in species ranging from humans to mice to insects and have been richly described in psychology and ecology, but virtually nothing is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that govern the remarkable coordination of large groups of animals. Systems neuroscience has exploded with a number of novel technologies, yet the culture of this field has been largely reductionist – focusing on animals living in isolation or with a single-digit number of cage mates performing highly-controlled tasks. Although there is abundant ongoing research in the domain of social reward (motivation to engage in social behavior for hedonic value that social interaction provides), there is no ongoing research (to my knowledge) examining the neural representation of a negative valence need state (a loneliness-like state), the social homeostatic set-point, or how this is related to social rank. Indeed, this unexplored face of social behavior may have greater relevance to mental health and the burden on society. This proposal is completely different from any previous work done by myself or any investigator because we will do the following: 1) present a model for social homeostasis where social rank dictates the set-point for quality/quantity of social contact; 2) bridge behavioral ecology and systems neuroscience by using complex, naturalistic vivariums of large groups of mice in combination with nascent neural recording technology and expertise across a wide range of functional circuit dissection techniques; 3) simultaneously record across many brains using wireless recording devices to determine how composite dominance hierarchy is represented and determine whether meta-brain patterns for group social homeostasis (in both stable and dynamic phases) exist and observe how they change during dominance hierarchical reorganizations; and 4) identify site(s) and circuit(s) that represent social rank by applying machine learning approaches to decode ensembles that accurately predict the animal’s social rank, and use this information to move towards a mathematical model for social homeostasis on a supraorganismal group level. I propose to bring my expertise in modern systems neuroscience circuit dissection to reveal the neural underpinnings of social homeostasis on both an individual and group level. On an individual level, I seek to understand how deficits between the experienced social contact and the expectations dependent on social rank within a dominance hierarchy are represented within the brain, and how these signals are translated into motivational drive states. When investigating the neural representation of social homeostasis on the group level, we will record simultaneously in many animals using wireless devices within a naturalistic vivarium in a complex social hierarchy and look for a composite representation of the social supraorganismal group.",Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups,10015204,DP1AT009925,"['Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Dissection', 'Ecology', 'Face', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Knowledge', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Values', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'expectation', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'mathematical model', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social group', 'virtual']",NCCIH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP1,2020,1346800,0.06551043044678798
"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics. The outcome of the work will inform how emotions should be conceptualized within a broader research framework of mental health domains.",Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation,10059052,R01MH124112,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'movie', 'negative affect', 'neural network architecture', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,774444,0.035398799651391345
"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,9908180,R34MH119170,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Service delivery model', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavior test', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'emotional distress', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'outreach', 'parental involvement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'self help', 'service delivery', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'uptake']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,232191,0.02968674880518029
"The Molecular Underpinnings of Complex Social Behavior Humans are highly social. Our brains have evolved to recognize and interpret the expression of faces and to produce and process language. Our behavior is modulated by our social interactions, and defects in social cognition manifest themselves in various disorders, including depression and autism. However, it has remained challenging to model these conditions in classic genetic systems such as rodents and flies because they only display basic social behaviors. Social insects such as ants, on the other hand, have evolved sophisticated societies and social behaviors, including nestmate recognition and complex communication via chemical cues. Their behavior is contingent on the social environment, giving rise to cooperation and division of labor. We study ants to understand the basic genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Because most of the molecules that modulate social behavior, such as neuropeptides, biogenic amines, and epigenetic marks on DNA and histones are conserved from insects to mammals, many of the insights gained from ants will also be applicable to humans. Over the past five years we have developed tools for the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi, a species that combines complex social insect biology with unprecedented experimental control. We can now monitor social behavior using computer vision, measure, map, and pharmacologically manipulate candidate neuromodulators in the ant brain, and create stable gene knockout and transgenic lines using CRISPR technology. We will study the development, organization and activity of the ant antennal lobe, the part of the brain that processes the ants' sophisticated chemical language. We will also conduct a large unbiased screen to identify candidate neuromodulators that affect social behavior. We will then manipulate these candidates pharmacologically and genetically to describe their function in more detail. We will also genetically disrupt DNA methylation, a common epigenetic mark implicated in behavioral individuality and plasticity. Finally, we will study how communication and social behavior affect the performance of social groups in dynamic and challenging external environments. This work will elucidate how, on a molecular level, the brains of social partners interact. This work is innovative because it uses a novel and uniquely suited study species to take a complementary approach to important biological questions of biomedical relevance. It will produce additional tools and resources to further establish the clonal raider ant as a model system for behavioral genetics, and it will shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying social behavior, which can then be studied further in other species including humans. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental and mood disorders that entail severe social impairments such as autism and depression have been difficult to model in available genetic study systems due to a lack of complex social cognition. The proposed research will use the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi as a complementary model system to study the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of complex social behavior with an array of available molecular tools and behavioral assays. Given that many of the neuromodulators regulating social behavior are likely conserved between insects and mammals, this work will identify and characterize candidate molecular mechanisms that can then be studied further in other organisms, including humans.",The Molecular Underpinnings of Complex Social Behavior,9983727,R35GM127007,"['Affect', 'Ants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individuality', 'Insecta', 'Language', 'Light', 'Lobe', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'communication behavior', 'fly', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social group', 'tool']",NIGMS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,423750,0.07342159633693282
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,9962011,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translational Research', 'Wireless Technology', 'affiliative behavior', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mature animal', 'microphone', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound', 'source localization', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2020,578956,0.021938040229826573
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,9843172,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,393603,0.016591533075674413
"Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a peak onset during adolescence. While interventions are moderately effective for many adolescents, 40 to 70% will relapse within 5 years. Further, MDD relapse predicts academic difficulties, risky behaviors, and suicide. Thus, identifying mechanisms of MDD relapse is critical to clarify intervention targets for this significant public health problem.  During adolescence, social processes and dynamics (especially with peers) are particularly significant, although it is unclear which social processes are most critical to MDD relapse. The present study focuses on the role of social communication, a set of mechanisms involving the receiving and delivery of socially relevant information. Social communication is especially significant to adolescents, as maladaptive social communication can negatively impact the establishment and maintenance of relationships, thus increasing risk for MDD relapse.  For the proposed study, we will employ an NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) lens and use multiple measures (behavior, event-related potentials [ERPs], eye tracking) to compare adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with remitted depression (remMDD; N=200) to healthy controls (HC; N=100) on deficits in several aspects of social communication, including: (i) processing of nonverbal social information, (ii) processing of socioemotional feedback, and (iii) digital communication. First, Aim 1 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process two types of nonverbal social information—facial expressions (as indexed by reduced accuracy and abnormal ERPs [i.e., the N170]) and hand gesturing behaviors (assessed via eye-tracking). Second, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process socioemotional feedback (being accepted versus rejected by same-aged peers), a well-established trigger of adolescent MDD. Specifically, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit a reduced Late Positive Potential [LPP]), an ERP indexing emotional encoding, following positive social feedback from faux peers during a peer evaluation task. Third, using an innovative smartphone app, Aim 3 will collect multiple indicators of digital communication regarding the structure of adolescents’ digital social network (i.e., size of the network; frequency of communication) and sentiment of the communication with their digital social network (i.e., coding sentiment from their texts, social media posts); allowing us to test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit abnormal digital communication. Last, we will follow adolescents for 1-year to determine whether processing of nonverbal information, social feedback, and digital communication predict the escalation of depression symptoms and MDD relapse. Further, supervised machine learning will explore which social communication deficit(s) predict symptoms or MDD relapse, and whether these social processes predict outcomes independent of (or interaction with) other established predictors of relapse (e.g., stressful life events). In summary, the project has the promise to identify social process that contribute to recurrent depression, which, ultimately, will lead to innovative treatment approaches. Project Narrative Depression in adolescence is common and recurrent. While social processes and dynamics are particularly significant in adolescence, it is unclear which social processes are most critical to depression relapse. The present study uses an RDoC “lens” to examine the role of multiple aspects of social communication to determine which social communication deficit predicts the escalation of depression symptoms and relapse during a 1-year follow-up period.",Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression,9908456,R01MH119771,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Social Network', 'Social Processes', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Youth', 'aged', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'negative affect', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'recurrent depression', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'showing emotion', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,814533,0.057419822745992645
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9923725,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,451783,0.07152754900249282
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9889999,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,680053,0.035592801975548954
"Mining Social Media Messages for HIV Testing and Prevention Communication PROJECT SUMMARY With the advent of Big Data methods, social media is the proverbial low-hanging fruit to disseminate HIV prevention and testing messages on a large scale 1,2. These media already transmit messages on condom use, HIV testing, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), from government institutions, NGOs, private citizens, and community groups, but it does so in an informal way. This real-time repository of real-world health messages, along with our ability to mine and pinpoint counties that need to engage in a conversation about HIV prevention and testing, offers a unique opportunity to develop Big Data methods for geographically targeted message dissemination. Despite some interventions designed for online delivery 3–19, the overall potential of social media and their most promising contents (e.g., actionable messages with behavioral instructions) have surprisingly not been established to date. Our project will focus on the disease-burdened population of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM), and will develop a highly significant computing infrastructure (Aim 1) to automatically and continuously input social media postings from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, behavioral data from the American Men Internet Survey (AMIS), and HIV prevalence data from AIDSVu.org, and using that triangulation, to target counties that need social media messages about condom use, HIV testing, and/or PrEP for MSM. Using machine learning methods, the same platform will then select actionable and acceptable messages to fill county gaps. Once the platform has been refined with input from research participants who are employees of health departments, it will be used to send experimental messages (Aim 2), selected to match county needs, and to be actionable and acceptable to a group of health departments randomized to the experimental condition. The success of the experimental messages will be gauged by the hallmarks of social media, repostings, Likes, Dislike, and comment favorability, compared with the success of a random selection of HIV-relevant messages sent to a different group of health departments randomized to the control condition. The project is innovative in several ways. First, the social media messages will involve diverse inputs (text, images, videos) never before brought together in this area. Second, we are not aware of the prior use of the proposed triangulation involving epidemiological, behavioral, and social media data. Third, a method of mining naturally accruing messages will be new and transformative, allowing for the generation of “live” campaigns with messages selected that remain current, sustainable, and community-based by design. Further, the use of an implementation-science experiment at a large, geographically distributed, scale is highly novel.

"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,9979950,R01LM012974,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Semantics', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'behavior change', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'digital', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'network models', 'nicotine patch', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'supervised learning', 'virtual coach']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,342713,0.05863671712942585
"Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media 2/12/2019 ProjectSummary - Google Docs Project Summary I will leverage social media conversations, specifically Reddit, to examine treatment help-seeking at an unprecedented scale, thereby collecting evidence “in the wild” as a new strategy to monitor and respond to the opioid crisis through the following aims. Aim 1. Data Driven Characterization of Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users: I will systematically identify Reddit posts about opioids, identify if the post is help-seeking for treatment, and contextualize the content of help-seeking posts. Aim 2. Data Driven Characterization of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to understand how peers organically respond to help-seeking for treatment by building data-driven models to discern what attributes of posts are predictive of receiving a response from a peer and to examine the typical content and reciprocity of responses. Aim 3. Assess the Quality of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to identify the types of treatment, treatment services, and treatment referral services that are provided in the responses and assess the quality of lay responses to opioid treatment help-seeking. Currently, little is known about how drug users engage social media to support or combat their addictions. Reddit is the sixth most popular website in the US with many reporters noting that it may be the last lifeline for opioid users. Yet, little has been done to tap this potential source for social media monitoring, especially given the difficulty of finding self-identified opioid users who are already contemplating strategies to treat their addiction. This study adds a new significant perspective to social media monitoring and will be among the first in public health to consider social media conversation threads by assessing unique posts about opioid help-seeking, the responses these posts get, and the quality of responses to addiction help-seeking, thereby creating a knowledge base for public health leaders to respond. Success of these aims will generate a number of future research directions that will support interventions that address the needs of self-identified opioid users seeking help on Reddit. Moreover, within all three aims this study will bring significant methodological advances to the study of social media around substance use with the aims relying heavily on automated approaches and analysis first developed in the computational sciences engendering more data scientists to join public health to create actionable knowledge. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4XHd63xhPZT8OFf9bHQ2q6XHpYp_c4AbouAOtAC3SU/edit 1/1 2/12/2019 ProjectNarrative - Google Docs Project Narrative An explosion of surveillance tools fueled by big media data (including social media) is changing public health. These data reveal what a person is thinking/doing and when they are thinking/doing it based on the content and timing of their public posts, providing an assessment of organic help-seeking for addiction and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing that was never before possible. I will extract actionable intelligence from social media data, specifically Reddit, to support more agile, responsive opioid intervention research by studying (a) treatment help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, (b) lay responses to help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, and (c) whether lay peers link self-identified opioid users to evidence-based treatment, treatment services, or treatment referral services. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyIXTdDAbFSkCe81q6hThDiZzKGCXkCy8npWgzr5wfM/edit 1/1",Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media,9872029,K25DA049944,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Code', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Drug user', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Hotlines', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Social intelligence', 'Source', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'combat', 'dissemination trial', 'evidence base', 'help-seeking behavior', 'illicit opioid', 'knowledge base', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'peer', 'phrases', 'posters', 'prescription opioid', 'public health intervention', 'referral services', 'research study', 'response', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K25,2020,189498,0.032560392882207544
"Characterization of Misinformation Dynamics in COVID-19 related health information in online social media Abstract: Social media has become predominant as a source of information for many health care consumers. However false and misleading information are a pervasive problem in this context. Specifically, during CVID-19 pandemic, misinformation has been a significant public health challenge, impeding the effectiveness of public health awareness campaigns and resulting in suboptimal responsiveness to the communication of legitimate risk- related information. In the proposed research, we will apply our “Pragmatics to Reveal Intent in Social Media (PRISM) framework to facilitate automated detection of intent and belief attributes underlying COVID-19 related misinformation. The PRISM framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study social processes and cognitive factors underlying misinformation comprehension. Such analysis forms the foundational step towards characterization of misinformation seeding and perception in digital social settings, ultimately allowing us to develop scalable and reliable computational infrastructure that can help formulate resilient and effective dissemination approaches to negotiate misinformation spread, easing public health burden and informing policy regulations as needed.

"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10002290,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,530057,0.041833686590581634
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10058351,R01MH071589,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'aversive conditioning', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'gang', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'reward processing', 'stem', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,719764,-0.0068339956851000885
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9840518,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,573248,0.06046875595423988
"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games. This work will address for the first time how these important neuromodulators encode social processes important for healthy cognition and affected by disease and injury.",Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans,10059060,R01MH124115,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Catecholamines', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Essential Tremor', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Serotonergic System', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Perception', 'Social Processes', 'System', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'dopamine system', 'human model', 'implantation', 'information processing', 'mental state', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social norm', 'social relationships']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,1077472,0.009371824970446838
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9988505,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,932115,0.012946292254336437
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results across studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media.",Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight ,10002211,K02DA043657,"['ATOD', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Latina', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Media Campaign', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survey Methodology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Twitter', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career development', 'data mining', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'hookah', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social factors', 'social implication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2020,118137,0.052345753348863384
