"Computational modeling of 60Hz STN DBS for gait disorder in Parkinson's disease Project Summary The therapeutic gain of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) has relied on high frequency stimulation (HFS) (e.g., 130-185Hz) to alleviate cardinal motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor, along with levodopa motor complications (e.g., motor fluctuations and dyskinesia). As the disease progresses, gait disorder, including freezing of gait, may emerge, increasing the risk of falls while limiting socialization and quality of life. Oftentimes, such symptoms are recalcitrant to dopaminergic medications and STN-DBS. Studies suggest that low frequency stimulation (60-80Hz) may improve gait in those with chronic DBS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 60Hz STN-DBS provides gait improvement within the first year of DBS implantation. However, there is limited data on the nature of this response, in terms of what aspects of gait respond and its relation to dopaminergic medications. In addition, based on preliminary results, it is possible to use machine-learning models to identify patients who may overall benefit from 60Hz STN-DBS based solely on preoperative assessments. However, the extent to which patients’ symptoms may improve under 60Hz STN-DBS needs to be further investigated. This project aims to (1) investigate the impact of 60Hz STN-DBS on gait kinematics using wearable sensors; and (2) develop machine learning models to predict response of STN-DBS patient symptomatology at both high frequency and 60Hz based on sensor profiles of PD motor symptoms at baseline. Parkinson’s patients with gait disorder who will either be undergoing STN-DBS implantation or already have chronic bilateral STN-DBS will be recruited. We will conduct the study in two phases: Phase I – obtain baseline kinematic profile for each subject in terms of tremor, bradykinesia, and gait using objective sensor measurements in the unmedicated and levodopa-ON states. We will specifically assess gait parameters within three domains: postural sway, gait speed and rhythm (cadence), and circumduction. Phase II – participants will be evaluated in two conditions: 1) OFF medication/ON stimulation; 2) ON medication/ON stimulation. Sensor-based gait analysis will be done in 60Hz and HFS modes for each DBS electrode contact pair in the different medication states. Following data collection, statistical analysis will be performed and machine learning models will be developed to accomplish aims (1) and (2). Accordingly, this study will help determine the aspects of gait influenced by 60Hz stimulation and how it is affected by levodopa, while potentially identifying certain 60Hz responsive PD phenotypic subtypes. It will also allow for instantaneous recommendations by artificial intelligence on which stimulation frequency is best suitable for a subject based on a priori sensor measurements of motor symptoms. The ranking provided can guide clinical evaluations and programming through a sensor guided paradigm.

"CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation The discovery that aberrant synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity recorded in PD patients is suppressed by DBS has advanced the concept that measures associated with pathological activity may be used as biomarkers to control the delivery of DBS therapy. Pilot studies of aDBS in PD have reported promising clinical results from triggering DBS stimulation when the signal recorded from the DBS electrode showed a high level of oscillatory power in the beta frequency range (13 – 35 Hz). That approach, however, has important limitations. Most importantly, beta power recorded from the DBS lead is suppressed by movement including PD tremor, its detection is highly dependent on lead location and the recording montage needed to record during stimulation is incompatible with directional current steering, a recent innovation employing segmented stimulation contacts. The inherent complexity of the increased parameter space through DBS innovations also overwhelms standard programming techniques. Finally, use of additional biomarker signals (e.g., recorded from cortex) is likely to improve the ability to adaptively control DBS for disorders marked by complex multidimensional symptomatologies such as PD. The current proposal will establish methods for overcoming these limitations by developing techniques for multi-feature classification from ECoG recordings, using advanced machine learning algorithms. The proposed research builds upon the extensive and unique experiences with multi-day, extra-operative recording from DBS leads in patients at Charité Hospital and intraoperative ECoG and DBS recording from patients at the University of Pittsburgh, in order to develop computational methods to advance closed-loop, adaptive DBS (aDBS) strategies for movement disorders. This research seeks to improve computational methods for interpreting brain signals recorded from patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. The results may inform the design of novel strategies for biomarker-responsive brain stimulation.",CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,10021999,R01NS110424,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Berlin', 'Biological Markers', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'reduce symptoms', 'remote sensor', 'symptomatology', 'translational neuroscience']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,228673,0.02214757476314968
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Acute', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Correlation Studies', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Team', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rogaine', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord damage', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dorsal column', 'early detection biomarkers', 'expectation', 'functional independence', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'restoration', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'spinal cord imaging']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,0.041081220088619017
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,9699018,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,329650,0.03420823292497214
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9773039,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'assistive robot', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2019,329494,0.033114290792099335
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9675333,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,363758,0.016478830051960158
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9739115,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2019,579461,0.03887549747077914
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9718308,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,530307,-0.005291596580441546
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,9871513,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,134007,0.012188447099782597
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9835325,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2019,99879,-0.0072074676233636215
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,9814049,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Indium-111', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1290521,0.04141682929394368
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9775220,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2019,2994145,-0.012112993214468402
"Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a tool to help diagnose and monitor movement disorders. Due to increasing and aging world population, more people are living with these disorders. As there is already a shortage of neurologists, and more specifically, movement disorder specialists that have the training to adequately diagnose and manage these disorders, there is a large number of patients that are not receiving optimal treatment. We propose to use a smartphone-based platform to assess the severity of symptoms that are common across different movement disorders in order to achieve our long-term goal. To that end, the current study proposes to tackle 4 specific aims. The first aim will be to develop a mobile application to quantify common symptoms of movement disorders. We will develop a new mobile application that will enable the quantification of symptom severity; namely rest tremor, postural tremor, intention tremor, kinetic tremor, upper-limb coordination, bradykinesia, balance, gait, and cognitive impairments. The data collected from the smartphone-embedded sensors will be transmitted to a secure server where data can be visualized and analyzed. The second aim will be to collect data using the mobile application from healthy individuals as well as individuals with different movement disorders. We will collect data from 30 healthy controls, 30 individuals with Essential tremor (ET), 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), 30 individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), 30 individuals with primary focal dystonia (PFD) of the upper-limb, 30 individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, and 30 individuals with functional movement disorder (FMD). This dataset will enable us to develop algorithms (Aim 3) that will be used to assess symptom severity and differentiate the movement disorders according to the smartphone data. The third aim will be to develop algorithms to estimate symptom severity and distinguish the different movement disorders from one another. Using the data from the smartphone-embedded sensors, we will utilize machine learning approaches to estimate symptom severity (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, gait impairment, etc.). Then, based on the symptom severity estimation as well as from features extracted from the sensor data, we will classify the subjects in groups according to their clinical diagnosis. This will enable us to differentiate the selected movement disorders. Finally, the fourth aim will be to assess the usability of the smartphone platform for long-term monitoring of patients. Subjects of patients recruited for Aim 2 will be asked to use the smartphone application at home for 8 weeks in order to determine compliance with its use and its stability over time. This study will provide a novel tool to assess motor and non-motor symptoms that could be used in other areas of research. It will provide a large database of movement, cognitive, demographic, and medical history data of individuals with different movement disorders. Most importantly, it will help in the differentiation and monitoring of movement disorders to improve the clinical management of individuals with these disorders. The prevalence of movement disorders is on the rise due to the expanding and aging world population while there is a lack of trained specialists in, and especially outside, of developed urban centers to adequately diagnose and manage those individuals. We propose that the ubiquity of smartphones could be leveraged to help non- specialists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of movement disorders that often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as Essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary focal dystonia, spinocerebllar ataxia, and functional movement disorders. We will develop a smartphone application that will collect data during different tasks to help differentiate these disorders and monitor them over time.",Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders,9655625,R15NS109741,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Economics', 'Equilibrium', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Gait', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Dystonias', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Rest Tremor', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'equilibration disorder', 'functional disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NINDS,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R15,2019,399532,0.012779809149328795
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,9914633,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,297755,0.0034718755628003295
"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9762992,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'E-learning', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2019,30689,0.02232341158582673
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9765066,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,34556,0.015549059936818726
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9818745,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1164920,-0.004104758395902802
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9707897,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,641907,0.030573738081878462
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation. Discovery in this area can  help improve understanding of neurologic disorders and development of new stimulation therapies. n/a",CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits,9916954,R01NS115327,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Closure by clamp', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventroposterior Medial Nucleus of the Thalamus', 'Vibrissae', 'awake', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'technology development', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,325241,-0.014980182288829387
"Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to develop a widely adoptable, high-throughput, functional connectomics platform to semi-automatically reconstruct and analyze the synaptic connectivity of functionally characterized neuronal microcircuits. We will develop this pipeline in the context of understanding neural microcircuits that control walking, using the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) as a model system. The VNC constitutes over a third of the fly central nervous system, and functions like the spinal cord to control movement and sensation of the limbs. It has a tractable number of neurons (~60,000), many of which are genetically identified and anatomically stereotyped, making it an excellent brain region for developing a comprehensive approach to characterize neuronal circuits. Our approach will integrate several technologies from our labs, including in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in walking flies, high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (EM), automated, deep- learning based connectomic reconstruction, and cell morphology-based analytics. Using this pipeline we will generate the first dense functional connectomes of the VNC, including the sensorimotor leg circuitry from multiple male and female flies. We will use these data to test the hypothesis that there exist specific patterns of synaptic connectivity between functional subtypes of leg proprioceptors and motor neurons. By creating the first connectomes of a microcircuit that orchestrates walking behavior, we anticipate this project will provide new and fundamental insight into the circuit basis of sensorimotor transformation and motor control. It will also create an important resource for the Drosophila and neuroscience communities, through publicly available tools and datasets that integrate connectivity, morphology, and cellular physiology data. Moreover, the technical approaches we develop for high-throughput functional connectomics can be readily applied to other brain regions and across species. Project Narrative Detailed mapping of neural computations and the neuronal circuits that underlie them is crucial for a comprehensive understanding central nervous system function in health and disease. Our goal is to develop an accessible, high-throughput pipeline of tools that we will use to dissect the relationship between neuronal connectivity and function in circuits that control walking. We will focus on sensorimotor transformations in the tractable genetic model organism Drosophila to dissect fundamental principles of proprioceptive feedback in motor control, while improving the speed and accessibility of functional connectomics for the broader scientific community.",Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics,9822460,RF1MH117808,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrical Synapse', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System control', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Property', 'Proprioceptor', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Walking', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fly', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'light microscopy', 'male', 'motor control', 'motor neuron function', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sex', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'two-photon']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2019,4347595,-0.020327633271221814
"Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex Project Summary/Abstract: For animals to execute complicated behaviors, successful motor planning and execution is essential. Moreover, the sequence of events leading to successful goal-based behavior takes place over a wide range of timescales. For example, when walking from home to work, one must first make an abstract, long-timescale decision to go to work, which much then be translated into a sequence of shorter-timescale right-left turning decisions, which are translated into the finely fluctuating electrical patterns that control the muscles. How motor planning and execution occur simultaneously over many timescales in populations of motor cortex neurons is not well understood. Much work in humans and nonhuman primates have shown that visual and auditory stimuli integrate over multiple timescales. This work has shown that early sensory regions, like primary visual cortex, respond to fast fluctuations in the environment. This information is integrated to longer-timescale information in secondary cortical regions, with the longest- timescale information in frontal and association areas. We therefore hypothesize that secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons control behavior over longer timescales than primary motor cortex (M1) neurons. To study this phenomenon, I have built a setup in which head-fixed mice navigate in virtual reality to a rewarded location. In this setup, I can record video from all sides of the animal for high spatiotemporal resolution measurement of motor behaviors. I have developed machine learning algorithms to extract 3D pose data from these videos. In Aim 1, I will use calcium imaging to record large numbers of neurons in mouse M1 and M2 to correlate the activity of individual neurons and populations to the animal’s ongoing pose kinematics. We will supplement with targeted silicon probe recordings to capture fast neural responses. In Aim 2, I will compare the calcium dynamics in populations of M1 and M2 neurons in mice trained to perform a virtual motor planning task versus mice that have not been trained. We hypothesize that training to plan motor actions increases the timescale of M1/M2 neural activity. In Aim 3, we will use optogenetic silencing in specific regions of cortex to perturb the animal’s motor behavior. We hypothesize that the duration of the perturbed movements will be longer when M2 is perturbed than M1. In this way, we will study how different cortical regions relate to behavior over many timescales. This proposal will broaden our knowledge of cortical processing in general, and motor planning and execution in particular. Patients with mental illness, such as ADHD, autism, and Asperger’s disorder show impaired ability to plan upcoming movements. The first step to successfully treating these illnesses is to better understand how motor planning occurs in general. Project Narrative: This proposal will elucidate how motor planning and execution take place simultaneously, over many timescales, and across brain regions. Better understanding motor planning will help generate new treatments for diseases that affect motor planning, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.",Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex,9752759,F31NS108450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Asperger Syndrome', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Stereotyping', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'area striata', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'frontal lobe', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,38053,0.04778312147267496
"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,9816407,R01NS081118,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dysarthria', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Essential Tremor', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Harmaline', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paresthesia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Radiation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Utah', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'motor symptom', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'research study', 'side effect', 'somatosensory', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'zona incerta']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,583682,0.005441241625546796
"Adaptive & Individualized AAC The heterogeneity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions such as manual signs, gestures or dexterous interaction with a touchscreen for communication. While efforts to develop alternative access methods through eye or head tracking have provided some communication advancements for these individuals, all current technologies suffer from the same fundamental limitation: existing AAC devices require patients to conform to generic communication access methods and interfaces rather than the device conforming to the user. Consequently, AAC users are forced to settle for interventions that require excessive training and cognitive workload only to deliver extremely slow information transfer rates (ITRs) and recurrent communication errors that ultimately deprive them of the fundamental human right of communication. To meet this health need, we propose the first smart-AAC system designed using individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. Preliminary research by our team of speech researchers at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital (Communication Center Lab) and Boston University (STEPP Lab), utilizing wearable sensors developed by our group (Altec, Inc) have already demonstrated that metrics based on surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer measures of muscle activity and movement for head-mediated control can be combined with optimizable AAC interfaces to improve ITRs when compared with traditional unoptimized AAC devices. Leveraging this pilot work, our team is now proposing a Phase I project to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that a single sEMG/IMU hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in ITR and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is optimized through machine learning algorithms. The prototype system will be tested and compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface in subjects with SPI at a collaborative clinical site. Assistance by our speech and expert-AAC collaborators will ensure that all phases of technology development are patient-centric and usable in the context of clinical care. In Phase II we will build upon this proof-of-concept to design a smart-AAC system with automated optimization software that achieves dynamic learning which adapts to intra-individual changes in function through disease progression or training as well as inter-individual differences in motor impairments for a diverse set of users with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, ALS, and other SPIs. The innovation is the first and only AAC technology that combines advancements in wearable-sensor access with interfaces that are autonomously optimized to the user, thereby reducing the resources and training needed to achieve effective person-centric communication in SPI, through improved HMI performance and reduced workload. This project addresses the fundamental mission of NIDCD (National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders) to provide a direct means of assisting communication for people with severe physical impairments caused by stroke, high level spinal cord injury, neural degeneration, or neuromuscular disease. Leveraging wearable access technology (which has barely been explored for AAC users), we will develop a first-of-its-kind adaptive tablet interface tailored to individual users through advanced movement classification algorithms. Through these efforts, we aim to provide an improved Human Machine Interface (HMI) that is able to accommodate varying degrees of inter- and intra-subject residual motor function and context dependent impairments to provide individuals with SPI the opportunity for improved societal integration and quality of life.",Adaptive & Individualized AAC,9907832,R43DC018437,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'American', 'Boston', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fatigue', 'Forehead', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human Rights', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'communication device', 'deafness', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering', 'rehabilitation science', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'signal processing', 'technology development', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2019,224701,-0.008514046079253048
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. Project Summary Synapses between neurons are plastic – able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an “error signal” that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers are other cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circuit uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorders, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9764342,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,34022,0.03590658612792833
"Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication Project Summary Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for people with severe speech and motor impairments (SSMI) rely on residual motor function, inherently limiting communication throughput. Commercially available AAC solutions require daily caregiver setup, need frequent recalibration often from a technically savvy caregiver, are often unable to be used in dark lighting conditions, and can encumber or fatigue important remaining physical abilities. Furthermore, for people with progressive motor dysfunction due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even the most well-designed AAC devices will eventually fail as movements become unreliable. For people with brainstem stroke, ALS, and other disorders causing locked-in syndrome (LIS) or SSMI, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise as a method of enabling communication that does not rely upon speech or voluntary movement. In prior NIDCD-supported research, our BrainGate research team provided early proofs of principle of a powerful intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that decodes movement intentions directly from brain activity. This technology has allowed people to control a cursor on a computer screen for communication simply by imagining movements of their own arm. The proposed NIDCD U01 clinical research will further the development and testing of a fully implanted iBCI that could provide robust, intuitive control of industry-grade communication apps for people with LIS or SSMI. By leveraging the ongoing pilot clinical trials of the investigational BrainGate system, we aim to (1) improve the robustness and accuracy of neurally actuated point-and click, in part through the translation of neuronal activity from human premotor and motor cortex, (2) expand the number of input dimensions to tablet computers available via neural activity, allowing intended hand gesture commands to control communication apps on touch-screen tablet computers, and (3) rigorously compare the performance of the investigational BrainGate system to trial participants’ conventional AAC systems with respect to communication competence, information throughput, user preference and outcomes measures. By incorporating the feedback of six individual participants with paralysis, this feasibility trial will optimize a powerful iBCI for communication and will establish the metrics needed for a subsequent pivotal trial of a fully implanted, always-available iBCI communication system for people with SSMI. Project Narrative People with brainstem stroke, advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), or other disorders can become unable to move or speak despite being awake and alert. In this project, we seek to further translate knowledge about interpreting brain signals related to movement, and to further develop an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that could restore rapid and intuitive use of communication apps on tablet computers by people with paralysis.","Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication",9729335,U01DC017844,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem Infarctions', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Interactive Communication', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Outcome Measure', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'communication device', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'long short term memory network', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'neural implant', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'phrases', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional']",NIDCD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,837287,-0.00464095919820884

Co-Investigators: Benjamin Blankertz, PhD, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Berlin; Tom Mitchell, PhD, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 1 Introduction and Objectives  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents one of the major clinical breakthroughs in the age of translational neuroscience.1 In 1987, Benabid and colleagues demonstrated that high frequency stimulation can mimic the effects of ablative neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease (PD)2'3, while offering two key advantages to previous procedures: adjustability and reversibility. This project will employ artificial intelligence strategies, which have allowed for unprecedented innovations in translational, personalized, high-definition medicine4, to further elevate the therapeutic potential of DBS. By developing a computational framework for decoding behavioral and disease states from combined subthalamic and cortical population recordings, this work will inform future adaptive stimulation paradigms for PD and other movement disorders. The central aim is to develop a computational framework for deep learning- based multi-feature decoding of behavioral and disease states from electrocorticography (ECoG), in order to advance the evolution of aDBS. Proposed Research. The concurrent use ofresearch ECoG during DBS surgery recently has enabled basic neuroscience investigation ofhuman co11ical-subcortical network dynamics. The overall goal ofthis project is to establish intelligent algorithms to identify physiological and pathophysiological states in ECoG data that predict epochs during which stimulation would facilitate movement or reduce symptoms. Given that ECoG electrode strips can be implanted safely during DBS surge1y5·6, the use of ECoG for aDBS is hypothesized to have several advantages: 1. compatibility with any DBS electrode design; 2. optimal signal  to noise ratio, 3. customization of electrode implantation location, based on known network connectivity of the target nucleus; 4. potential implantation of multiple remote sensors in different brain regions. Several barriers, however, exi'st for advancing this type of strategy. Namely, neither instantaneous biomarkers, evidence for optimal recording locations, adaptive control algorithms, nor previous reports on the use of ECoG-based, adaptive DBS have been described in PD patients. These obstacles will be overcome through achieving the following: Objective #1: Identify cortical and subthalamic biomarkers that can distinguish activity related to physiological motor behaviorfrom that related to pathological symptoms. The goal of objective 1 is to distinguish oscillatory features in population activity based on the temporal, spectral and spatial specificity of their synchronization across the corticosubthalamic axis, e.g. characteristic evolution of beta activity with bradykinesia vs. rhythmic high frequency activity  synchronized during tremor. Features that reflect instantaneous motor behavior and parkinsonian symptom  severity will be characterized through spectral decomposition mapped to 3D reconstructions of recording locations.  Objective #2: Determi11e tlte optimal computational approaclt fol' real-time ,letection and prediction of physiological andpatliophysiological behaviors.  The goal of objective 2 is to use results from the first objective to build a computational framework for deep learning of physiological and pathophysiological states from cortical time-series data based on  hierarchical recurrent artificial neural networks.

"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles.

"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Summary / Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project proposes the development of an image- processing-based tool, named PostureCheck™, aimed at automatically detecting when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation exercises. The system will be based on a standard video camera (e.g., GoPro) that will be used to capture the movements of the subject.  The automatic detection of undesirable compensatory movements is especially important when patients use a rehabilitation robotic system with minimum supervision, i.e. when a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of multiple patients simultaneously. In this context, PostureCheck™ may be capable of tracking robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises and enable feedback modalities to discourage the performance of undesirable compensatory movements.  Our long-term goal is to integrate PostureCheck™ with the Barrett Upper-extremity Robotic Trainer - BURT®, which we developed with special emphasis on stroke rehabilitation. The combination of PostureCheck™ with the BURT® device would be ideally suited for deployment in “Robotic Gyms”, where a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of several patients simultaneously, thus allowing rehabilitation centers to offer high-dosage, high-intensity interventions despite the limited number of therapists currently available in the US.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we will develop PostureCheck™ to detect the most common compensatory movements automatically. To achieve this goal, we will rely on recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) methods referred to as Deep Learning. These methods have recently broken records in the human-posture analysis, joint-skeleton detection, and recognition of human activities using a single inexpensive camera. The proposed video-based PostureCheck™ tool will be the first system to exploit the capabilities of hybrid Deep Neural Networks, for real-time detection of compensatory movements during robot- assisted rehabilitation.  The proposed SBIR Phase-I activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, feedback from rehabilitation experts at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital will be used to collect video data and to label compensatory movements observed during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises by using the BURT® system. In Aim 2, Deep Learning techniques will be used to develop a robust detection of undesirable compensatory movements during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises. Finally, in Aim 3, the algorithms developed in Aim 2 will be optimized. Specifically, we will test implementations that are suitable to generate real-time feedback. Computationally efficient implementations of the algorithms will enable - in future studies - the development of new modalities of control of the rehabilitation robot with the objective of discouraging undesirable compensatory movements. Project Narrative  Each year, nearly 800,000 Americans suffer from a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and - eventually - improved function. This proposal aims to develop a novel video-based tool, named PostureCheck™, to detect undesirable compensatory movements and enable automatic corrective feedback to the patient during robot- assisted upper-limb therapy.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,9678997,R43EB027525,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Records', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Vision', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dosage', 'efficacy evaluation', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'meetings', 'monocular', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic device', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R43,2018,223752,-0.05948593858414061
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9448794,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2018,331851,0.033114290792099335
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9455790,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,377627,0.016478830051960158
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Wireless Movement Sensing System for People with Severe Disabilities Abstract The ability of people with severe physical impairment to participate in family life, communication, work, or recreation is severely restricted without access to assistive technology (AT). Yet, as disability severity increases, so does the challenge to finding (1) an access movement that a person can perform to control AT and (2) an access technology that can detect the access movement. We propose to create a wireless movement sensing system that can learn a user’s access movement and then recognize that movement in order to wirelessly control assistive devices. Once we complete the technology development, we will measure the sensitivity and specificity of our wireless movement sensing system using the movements of ten people with SPI. We will present our results to AT experts during a focus group session and determine the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the technology. This Phase 1 research is proposed by a multidisciplinary research team consisting of AT engineers, AT clinicians, and a machine learning expert.

"Quantitative Handwriting Assessment Tool for Healthy and Impaired Children No technology currently exists for objective assessment of handwriting, even though over 3 million individuals in the United States suffer from disorders that affect handwriting, including 2.7 million children with dyspraxia and over 300,000 older adults with Parkinson's disease. This lack of assessment technology creates a barrier to effective care, because occupational therapists cannot easily distinguish motor disorders from non- motor causes of handwriting disability, a necessary step toward developing appropriate treatment plans. Our goal is to develop Write to Hand, the first quantitative digital assessment of the motor skills that underlie handwriting.  In partnership with Washington University in St. Louis, PlatformSTL is uniquely suited to address the handwriting assessment gap. Our team is led by a neuroscientist who developed the Precision Drawing Task, a laboratory research tool with an established history of successful assessment and training of writing-related motor skills. The Precision Drawing Task will serve as the basis for Write to Hand. Our Phase I objective is to develop a fully functional prototype of Write to Hand, and demonstrate scientific validity in children grades 4-5. Data analysis will include an initial application of a machine learning approach, which will test its feasibility in advance of its primary role in Phase II.  Aim 1 of this STTR is to develop the Write to Hand iPad app, which must meet seven specific criteria including: high-precision data collection with a fine-point stylus; rapid calculation of movement speed, smoothness, straightness, and error rate; and data anonymization that meets HIPAA and IRB standards. Aim 2 will demonstrate validity by comparing Write to Hand performance against a handwriting benchmark in 56 children grades 4-5. We expect that movement smoothness will significantly and meaningfully (r2 > 0.25) predict handwriting skill, and we will use a machine learning approach (Generalized Factorial Method) determine the most predictive classifier for handwriting skill, identify task features that optimize handwriting prediction, and demonstrate feasibility of our machine learning approach to characterize and classify Write to Hand data.  Our product will transform therapy for individuals with handwriting disabilities, by providing educators, therapists, and researchers with a gold standard for assessment and quantification of handwriting's underlying motor control skills. This will, for the first time, allow objective identification of motor impairment in local and tele-health settings. In Phase II we will collect data across participant ages to train our machine learning algorithm so Write to Hand can label performance with easy-to-interpret grade level ratings. Our commercialization plan focuses on occupational therapists and educators who serve children with motor disabilities.

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9558014,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,605627,0.0014171869597240526
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9616747,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,567754,-0.005291596580441546
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9483798,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,350000,0.015372822038428564
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9632111,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2018,99879,-0.0072074676233636215
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9524750,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,205290,0.07273546300773995
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9572928,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,1060180,0.08085407182899412
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9584824,U19NS107466,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2018,2979311,-0.012112993214468402
"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9604145,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2018,36509,0.01910430267366493
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions. Our methodology reveals various multiscale dynamical processes, relating measured neuronal activity to functional behavior, and has already uncovered activity patterns, dysfunction, and recovery stages.",Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling,9615161,R01EB026936,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Apical', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'behavior prediction', 'brain machine interface', 'computerized data processing', 'control theory', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'mathematical methods', 'network architecture', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensorimotor system', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,21381,0.023527133215902142
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9573606,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,34064,0.015549059936818726
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9504668,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,727051,0.030573738081878462
"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9638443,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2018,30197,0.02232341158582673
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism.

"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9538277,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,477795,0.013596643442705201
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation to neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern of interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9563948,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2018,33530,0.03590658612792833

"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9502398,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,341250,-0.006059155856354777
"2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary Dendrites play a central role in neuronal computation by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate the output of the neuron in the form of action potentials. Recent advances in molecular, electrophysiological and imaging techniques have led to a rapid enhancement in our understanding of the mechanisms that shape dendritic structure, function and connectivity and the contribution of dendritic computation to behavior. Computational and theoretical approaches have further refined our views of dendrites and their unique role in brain function. Notably, dendrite structure and function may undergo plastic changes that contribute to nervous system development and learning, and dysfunction in these mechanisms can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together researchers whose latest findings help clarify how the properties of dendrites enable them to perform complex computations important for sensory-motor processing and higher cognitive function.The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites. Project Narrative Neuronal dendrites receive and integrate inputs from other neurons to regulate the information flow through neural circuits. This Gordon Research Conference and Seminar will convene scientists of all levels and from diverse fields of neuroscience to present and discuss cutting-edge research on dendrite structure and function in health and disease.

"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9348402,R01HD087133,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'portability', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2017,477276,0.008704706682077259
"Machine Learning-Based Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of quadriplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9244854,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,30367,0.016478830051960158
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies.

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9351131,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2017,2910000,-0.0072074676233636215
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9315937,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,205290,0.07273546300773995
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,9358722,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'arm function', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,865006,0.0665474628431853
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9360609,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,457885,0.08085407182899412
"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9470585,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2017,36029,0.01910430267366493
"Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation PROJECT SUMMARY Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) results in unpredictable episodes of gait cessation, which may lead to falls, injury, a loss of independent living, and even death19. The treatment of FOG is inconsistent with either dopaminergic medication or with current open loop, continuous high frequency deep brain stimulation (cDBS)15, 25. Emerging technology using non-continuous, closed loop or adaptive DBS (aDBS), has the potential to improve treatment for FOG. Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ‘sensed’ by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Freezing of gait (FOG), a severe complication of Parkinson’s disease that could result in falls and even death, is not consistently well treated with current one-size fits all continuous deep brain stimulation therapy. Newly available adaptive DBS (aDBS) provides an opportunity to improve treatment of FOG by delivering precise medicine; real-time patient specific stimulation that is driven by patient specific neural signals. The goals of this project are to perform an in-depth analysis of the synchronized neural and kinematic data of freely moving patients, while stimulating with various settings to (1) better define these poorly understood patient specific signals and effective stimulation settings, and (2) to perform a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of whether patients can tolerate aDBS which continually adjusts the stimulation output.",Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation,9360002,R21NS096398,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'FDA approved', 'Fall injury', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cohort', 'comparative efficacy', 'computerized', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'human subject', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'new technology', 'patient safety', 'place fields', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety testing', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard care']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,0.00946135635757881
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9395809,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,33584,0.015549059936818726
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9277595,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,825202,0.030573738081878462
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9303234,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2017,249000,0.01112129492865823
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9324362,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plasticizers', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,479269,0.013596643442705201
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation to neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern of interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements:  characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9470632,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2017,33050,0.03590658612792833
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9618453,R01NS063399,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,273292,0.016478830051960158
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9284528,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,341250,-0.006059155856354777
"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation No abstract available NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9468229,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2017,29717,0.029439208718762825
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9146176,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social', 'technology training']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,477724,0.008704706682077259
"The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. The aim of this project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms of voluntary movement initiation. An essential component of voluntary movement is the choice of when to act. Under normal circumstances this decision can be time consuming usually taking up to a few hundreds of milliseconds, longer that the known delays in the nervous system. The area of the brain most associated with generating movements, the motor cortex, becomes very active just before and during the movement, however what exactly is happening during this time is still not well understood. Indeed, while much is known about the neural basis of generating movements, several open questions remain: does a movement generated deliberately with no time pressure, like a reach made to grab an object from a table, share the same neural underpinnings with a very fast reach to catch a falling object? Will the motor cortex be just as active before a quasi-automatic reach when time is of the essence? Or is pre-movement activity only present when there is enough time to deliberately plan the movement? During movement itself, is motor cortex involved in generating quasi-automatic reaches or is there is some reflex mechanism that bypasses motor cortex to generate urgent reaches? To begin answering these questions we have trained two monkeys to initiate a reach under three very different circumstances: sometimes monkeys move at a time of their own choosing with no imposed time constraints, other times monkeys must intercept a rapidly moving target on a screen, which elicits very short-latency reaches. In yet another set of trials monkeys must withhold a reach until given a go cue. The first aim of this project is to determine if these three movements (self-initiated, quasi-automatic and cue-initiated) share a common neural mechanism that does not depend on how the movement is initiated. To do this we will record the responses from a number of neurons in two key regions of the motor cortex: the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex. In order to understand and interpret these responses, we will employ cutting edge machine learning techniques that will allow us to visualize and quantify the how neural activity evolves in time. Being able to visualize the evolution of neural activity is a key component in understanding the principles that govern how the neural activity translates to movement. The second aim of this project is to elucidate the role that higher cortical areas play in the generation of voluntar movements. We will record neural activity from areas upstream of motor cortex (supplementary motor area), which is heavily interconnected with the motor cortex and is suspected to play crucial a role in determining when a movement should be initiated. We will test record neural activity from this area and characterize its properties using the same cutting edge techniques developed in the first part of this project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. Arguably, one of the fundamental features of voluntary movement is that one chooses when to move. The main goal of the proposed project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms responsible for voluntary movement initiation.                ",The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements,9148079,F32NS092350,"['Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Intercept', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Property Rights', 'Reflex action', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'grasp', 'millisecond', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2016,21140,0.03726104936246792
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8996729,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,308040,0.016478830051960158
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9185649,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'cell type', 'design', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,350000,0.015372822038428564
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9242184,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'research study', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,205290,0.07273546300773995
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing.

"Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation PROJECT SUMMARY Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) results in unpredictable episodes of gait cessation, which may lead to falls, injury, a loss of independent living, and even death19. The treatment of FOG is inconsistent with either dopaminergic medication or with current open loop, continuous high frequency deep brain stimulation (cDBS)15, 25. Emerging technology using non-continuous, closed loop or adaptive DBS (aDBS), has the potential to improve treatment for FOG. Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ‘sensed’ by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Freezing of gait (FOG), a severe complication of Parkinson’s disease that could result in falls and even death, is not consistently well treated with current one-size fits all continuous deep brain stimulation therapy. Newly available adaptive DBS (aDBS) provides an opportunity to improve treatment of FOG by delivering precise medicine; real-time patient specific stimulation that is driven by patient specific neural signals. The goals of this project are to perform an in-depth analysis of the synchronized neural and kinematic data of freely moving patients, while stimulating with various settings to (1) better define these poorly understood patient specific signals and effective stimulation settings, and (2) to perform a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of whether patients can tolerate aDBS which continually adjusts the stimulation output.",Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation,9244090,R21NS096398,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'FDA approved', 'Fall injury', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cohort', 'comparative efficacy', 'computerized', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'falls', 'human subject', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'new technology', 'patient safety', 'place fields', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'safety testing', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard care']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,235500,0.00946135635757881
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9177620,R01NS095251,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Records Controls', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,891206,0.030573738081878462
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,9098854,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2016,248999,0.01652320558996155
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism.

"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales.

"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 �m diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements:  characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.  We will also test whether information about these networks can be used to control an advanced robotic prosthetic arm.

"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9097799,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,341250,-0.006059155856354777
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9067563,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'robot assistance', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2015,503237,0.008704706682077259
"The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. The aim of this project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms of voluntary movement initiation. An essential component of voluntary movement is the choice of when to act. Under normal circumstances this decision can be time consuming usually taking up to a few hundreds of milliseconds, longer that the known delays in the nervous system. The area of the brain most associated with generating movements, the motor cortex, becomes very active just before and during the movement, however what exactly is happening during this time is still not well understood. Indeed, while much is known about the neural basis of generating movements, several open questions remain: does a movement generated deliberately with no time pressure, like a reach made to grab an object from a table, share the same neural underpinnings with a very fast reach to catch a falling object? Will the motor cortex be just as active before a quasi-automatic reach when time is of the essence? Or is pre-movement activity only present when there is enough time to deliberately plan the movement? During movement itself, is motor cortex involved in generating quasi-automatic reaches or is there is some reflex mechanism that bypasses motor cortex to generate urgent reaches? To begin answering these questions we have trained two monkeys to initiate a reach under three very different circumstances: sometimes monkeys move at a time of their own choosing with no imposed time constraints, other times monkeys must intercept a rapidly moving target on a screen, which elicits very short-latency reaches. In yet another set of trials monkeys must withhold a reach until given a go cue. The first aim of this project is to determine if these three movements (self-initiated, quasi-automatic and cue-initiated) share a common neural mechanism that does not depend on how the movement is initiated. To do this we will record the responses from a number of neurons in two key regions of the motor cortex: the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex. In order to understand and interpret these responses, we will employ cutting edge machine learning techniques that will allow us to visualize and quantify the how neural activity evolves in time. Being able to visualize the evolution of neural activity is a key component in understanding the principles that govern how the neural activity translates to movement. The second aim of this project is to elucidate the role that higher cortical areas play in the generation of voluntar movements. We will record neural activity from areas upstream of motor cortex (supplementary motor area), which is heavily interconnected with the motor cortex and is suspected to play crucial a role in determining when a movement should be initiated. We will test record neural activity from this area and characterize its properties using the same cutting edge techniques developed in the first part of this project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. Arguably, one of the fundamental features of voluntary movement is that one chooses when to move. The main goal of the proposed project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms responsible for voluntary movement initiation.                ",The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements,9051023,F32NS092350,"['Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Intercept', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Property Rights', 'Reflex action', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'grasp', 'millisecond', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2015,57962,0.03726104936246792
"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8806616,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Arm', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'myoelectric control', 'prosthesis control', 'prosthetic hand', 'relating to nervous system', 'residual limb', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,6800,0.030558272358757677
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.                ",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8887443,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,339124,0.016478830051960158
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,8932000,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'somatosensory', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2015,1085849,0.08085407182899412
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8889256,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'arm function', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2015,828196,0.0665474628431853
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level.

"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8807937,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,341436,0.0069106702480100516
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8898252,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2015,249000,0.01652320558996155
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain. Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8775624,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2015,90000,0.01112129492865823
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.            ",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,8964760,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plastics', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473336,0.013596643442705201
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 �m diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements:  characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.  We will also test whether information about these networks can be used to control an advanced robotic prosthetic arm.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions. Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8822295,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'image guided', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,376478,-0.02105538884056644
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8928250,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,341250,-0.006059155856354777
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.

"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.                 ",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8702940,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,47676,0.030558272358757677
"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.                  ",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,8696689,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,1152001,0.08085407182899412
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.                ",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8690845,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,819964,0.0665474628431853
"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.               ",Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju,8628880,R01NS066340,"['Algebraic Geometry', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Diffusion weighted imaging', 'Distant', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Registers', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'expectation', 'fiber cell', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'interest', 'member', 'morphometry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2014,494546,0.01604574322655077
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.   The current project develops novel imaging tools and analysis concepts to simultaneously study large groups of nerve cells in the awake brain with high temporal and cellular resolution, and will lay the groundwork for deeper insights into how the brain processes information and may provide mechanistic insights into brain disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.                ",Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics,8827121,U01NS090569,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'auditory discrimination', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'density', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'millisecond', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",U01,2014,250000,0.009134064895273073
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8624688,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,344886,0.0069106702480100516
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8892350,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2014,249000,0.01652320558996155
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment.

BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.           Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm. This project seeks to increase BMI performance dramatically by leveraging recent advances in systems neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through  multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8618418,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2014,90000,0.01112129492865823
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences. Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living. We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks. Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1). More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks. We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks. The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control. We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2). This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom. We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding. This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints. This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8634100,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,376478,-0.02105538884056644
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.                ",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8761846,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,339427,-0.006059155856354777
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control.

"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements.

"Restoring arm and hand motor function with non-invasive spinal stimulation.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of car can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the cervical cord to improve arm and hand function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical single-channel (stimulation of one part of the spinal cord) and dual-channel (stimulation of two different parts of the cord) paradigm that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the cervical spinal cord can improve motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a dual-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof- of-principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervical spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the cervical cord that improves use of the arms and hands.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Electrical modulation of the spinal cord can restore voluntary motor function in patients with spinal cord injury, a phenomenon we have demonstrated with both implantable electric devices and devices that provide electrical stimulation to the cord through the surface of the skin.

"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.                 ",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8526724,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,47232,0.030558272358757677

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.

"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.               ",Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju,8432789,R01NS066340,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Diffusion weighted imaging', 'Distant', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Registers', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'expectation', 'fiber cell', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'interest', 'member', 'morphometry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2013,480486,0.01604574322655077
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8505855,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,365000,0.0069106702480100516
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8424238,K99NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2013,90662,0.01652320558996155
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.           Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8451290,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,364955,-0.02105538884056644
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools.

"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.

"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires  a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models  to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.   Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically-controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g.,  directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology  necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible.  The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage""  and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less-constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,8290387,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robotics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'computer science', 'design', 'free behavior', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,227048,0.03338222493586585
"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.                This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function.

"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.           Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array to Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load- bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with pharmacological and motor training interventions.  Within the first 2.5 years of the present BRP Grant, not within the five years as initially proposed, we have gathered sufficient data to demonstrate that the human lumbosacral spinal cord has similar capabilities.  We have shown that an individual with a motor complete spinal cord injury can regain independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation after months of testing different spinal cord stimulation patterns and motor training.  Just as important and as impressive is the recovery of significant levels of bladder control, blood pressure, and temperature regulation, and even sexual function in this patient (13a).  These intriguing results compel us to begin additional efforts to overcome what are now recognized as the most critical factors limiting our progress toward making this intervention available in the clinic.  Based on our results, it is clear that we can develop the capability to selectively activae combinations of neural networks that can enable standing and probably stepping with improved technology in humans with a functionally motor complete spinal cord injury.  These functional improvements are even more likely to benefit those individuals that are functionally motor incomplete, but have severely impaired mobility.  Our present accomplishments have been realized using technology that is three decades old and initially designed for a different purpose, i.e., pain management.  Thus we are requesting funds to overcome the present technical, not physiological, limitations as expediently and as carefully as possible.  More specifically, the rat limiting factors are the lack of technology for chronic implants for a high number of electrodes and the need for a more clear understanding of how these epidural stimulation arrays can modulate the spinal circuitries.  To overcome these factors we need to 1) develop a device that will allow us to chronically implant an integrated electrode array and multiplexed stimulation device in rats with the necessary signal control capabilities, 2) evaluate hypotheses that will guide us to more clearly understand how to modulate the stimulation parameters to activate the desired spinal circuits, 3) develop a learning strategy to automatically optimize the stimulation parameters for a given patient to stand, step, or exert voluntary control, and 4) begin to explore the pathways through which voluntary control can be regained after a severe spinal cord injury.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.  This technology includes the capability to stimulate the lower spinal cord in a manner that can enable a patient with complete paraplegia to stand and to step.  This project outlines the newly recognized technical capabilities that must be developed to accomplish this goal.                   It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attrat our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.                  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage"" and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less- constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,8094411,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'design', 'free behavior', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,1141716,0.033841151515155106
"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.                 Narrative This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Di(R)usion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,8091226,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visual', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2011,167832,0.039197652139253934
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.              The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system, could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal.

"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage"" and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less- constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,7883275,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'design', 'free behavior', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,303756,0.033841151515155106
"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders. The successful development of this technology will be transferred for commercial development with the financial assistance of the Massachusetts Community Technology Foundation.         n/a",Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function,7922046,R01EB007163,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Body Surface', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hybrids', 'Inherited Spinocerebellar Degenerations', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Levodopa', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neurologist', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Principal Investigator', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'diaries', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2010,654993,0.030861533808919688
"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.                 Narrative This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Di(R)usion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7876844,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visual', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2010,167832,0.039197652139253934
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.

Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage"" and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less- constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,7725788,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Upper arm', 'Wireless Technology', 'design', 'free behavior', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,366873,0.033841151515155106
"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease.

"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7643089,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2009,167832,0.039197652139253934
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus. The proposed studies will investigate the possibility to reverse this situation and take advantage of advanced technologies for adapting the control apparatus to the residual skills of the patients. n/a",Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device,7488480,R21HD053608,"['Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Development', 'Elbow', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Head', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quadriplegia', 'Residual state', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wrist', 'base', 'body sense', 'computer generated', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'independent component analysis', 'motor learning', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R21,2008,98314,0.05573609545351233
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7392804,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,35821,0.025260663124059217
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders. The successful development of this technology will be transferred for commercial development with the financial assistance of the Massachusetts Community Technology Foundation.         n/a",Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function,7482475,R01EB007163,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Body Surface', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hybrids', 'Inherited Spinocerebellar Degenerations', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Levodopa', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neurologist', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Principal Investigator', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Week', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized data processing', 'day', 'design', 'diaries', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2008,637832,0.030861533808919688
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production.

"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed. Here we propose a collaborative research project between a mathematician (Kenneth Harris) and an electrophysiologist (Gyorgy Buzsaki), with the aim of recording, analyzing, and modeling the activity of large neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex and its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs. The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.      We will investigate the hypothesis that psychotomimetic effects of low doses of dissociative anesthetics are caused by a partial distortion in assembly organization, whereas larger doses cause a more complete distortion resulting anesthesia. If reliable signatures of psychotomimetic doses on assembly structure are found, this will suggest a novel method of drug screening for antipsychotics, whereby candidate drugs are evaluated by their ability to reverse these signatures. n/a",CRCNS: Info.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7470575,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Count', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2008,167832,0.039197652139253934
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7269518,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,35821,0.025260663124059217
"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus.

This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain. Solla (NU) is an expert in neural networks and information theory. With Romo, she will develop optimal routines to encode information in stimulus trains to provide feedback to the brain. Mussa-Ivaldi (NU) will focus on the overall design and evaluation of the interfaces.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders. The successful development of this technology will be transferred for commercial development with the financial assistance of the Massachusetts Community Technology Foundation.         n/a",Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function,7285272,R01EB007163,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Body Surface', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hybrids', 'Inherited Spinocerebellar Degenerations', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Levodopa', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neurologist', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Principal Investigator', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Week', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized data processing', 'day', 'design', 'diaries', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2007,617760,0.030861533808919688
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production.

"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed. Here we propose a collaborative research project between a mathematician (Kenneth Harris) and an electrophysiologist (Gyorgy Buzsaki), with the aim of recording, analyzing, and modeling the activity of large neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex and its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs. The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.      We will investigate the hypothesis that psychotomimetic effects of low doses of dissociative anesthetics are caused by a partial distortion in assembly organization, whereas larger doses cause a more complete distortion resulting anesthesia. If reliable signatures of psychotomimetic doses on assembly structure are found, this will suggest a novel method of drug screening for antipsychotics, whereby candidate drugs are evaluated by their ability to reverse these signatures. n/a",CRCNS: Info.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7318680,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Count', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2007,167832,0.039197652139253934
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES   A common feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurological movement disorders is that the peripheral neuromuscular system remains intact. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers the potential to restore movement in these individuals. Impressive improvements in electrode and sensor hardware have recently been made, but development of control algorithms for complex dynamic movements remains difficult.      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique from artificial intelligence that has the potential to overcome this problem. A RL-based control system learns from experience how to control movement, in very much the same way as an infant. The system receives information from multiple sensors, as well as a reward signal, and generates actions, i.e. muscle stiimulation levels, that are initially random. The system will learn to predict the consequences of its actions and will ultimately converge to a control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time. An essential feature of RL is that the control strategy is not created by the designer, but is learned from experience. This learning process could ultimately result in motor behavior of much higher quality than can be achieved with traditionally designed feedback control systems, which tend to ""fight"" rather than exploit the natural dynamics of the body such as inertia, pendulum and mass-spring mechanisms. Furthermore, a self learning system has the advantage that it can adapt itself to the user's body mass, muscle strength, as well as variations in electrode location.      The long-term goal is a system that integrates high-level commands from the user with signals from implanted sensors to produce intelligent and adaptive motor function. Feasibility of this concept will be tested here for FES control of six muscles in the upper extremity, to perform the task of reaching in the horizontal plane. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Implementation of RL control on a virtual arm with computer-generated commands and rewards, (2) RL control on a virtual arm, with commands and rewards given by a human operator, and (3) RL control of muscles in a paralyzed arm in two subjects with high cervical spinal cord injury, with commands and rewards given by the user via a head tracker based input device. n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES,7085349,R21HD049662,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'electrodes', 'electrostimulus', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'neuromuscular stimulator', 'neuroregulation', 'spinal cord injury']",NICHD,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COL/MED-CWRU,R21,2006,192359,0.058042196977936146
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders. The successful development of this technology will be transferred for commercial development with the financial assistance of the Massachusetts Community Technology Foundation.         n/a",Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function,7010950,R01EB007163,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'clinical research', 'fingers', 'gait', 'limbs']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,619987,0.030861533808919688
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production. It will be useful to clinicians for assessing the degree of dysfunction in upper motoneuron diseases such as Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Stroke, and other disorders.              n/a",Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior,7132833,R01NS058250,"['action potentials', 'behavior', 'clinical research', 'community', 'electrodes', 'muscle', 'training']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R01,2006,427941,0.049190254690907084
"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7125904,R01MH066990,"['bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neurophysiology', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'statistics /biometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2006,36891,0.025260663124059217
"INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES   A common feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurological movement disorders is that the peripheral neuromuscular system remains intact. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers the potential to restore movement in these individuals. Impressive improvements in electrode and sensor hardware have recently been made, but development of control algorithms for complex dynamic movements remains difficult.      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique from artificial intelligence that has the potential to overcome this problem. A RL-based control system learns from experience how to control movement, in very much the same way as an infant. The system receives information from multiple sensors, as well as a reward signal, and generates actions, i.e. muscle stiimulation levels, that are initially random. The system will learn to predict the consequences of its actions and will ultimately converge to a control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time. An essential feature of RL is that the control strategy is not created by the designer, but is learned from experience. This learning process could ultimately result in motor behavior of much higher quality than can be achieved with traditionally designed feedback control systems, which tend to ""fight"" rather than exploit the natural dynamics of the body such as inertia, pendulum and mass-spring mechanisms. Furthermore, a self learning system has the advantage that it can adapt itself to the user's body mass, muscle strength, as well as variations in electrode location.      The long-term goal is a system that integrates high-level commands from the user with signals from implanted sensors to produce intelligent and adaptive motor function. Feasibility of this concept will be tested here for FES control of six muscles in the upper extremity, to perform the task of reaching in the horizontal plane. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Implementation of RL control on a virtual arm with computer-generated commands and rewards, (2) RL control on a virtual arm, with commands and rewards given by a human operator, and (3) RL control of muscles in a paralyzed arm in two subjects with high cervical spinal cord injury, with commands and rewards given by the user via a head tracker based input device. n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES,6908435,R21HD049662,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'electrodes', 'electrostimulus', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'neuromuscular stimulator', 'neuroregulation', 'spinal cord injury']",NICHD,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COL/MED-CWRU,R21,2005,164156,0.058042196977936146
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6857150,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,358050,0.010562776938817712
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6889075,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'behavioral extinction', 'biological models', 'brain electronic stimulator', 'cerebellar Purkinje cell', 'cerebellar nuclei', 'cerebellum', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'electrophysiology', 'eye movements', 'laboratory rabbit', 'learning', 'microelectrodes', 'neural information processing', 'neural plasticity', 'neural transmission', 'neurons', 'operant conditionings', 'psychomotor function', 'reflex', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2005,222750,0.034283926553293355
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.

"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals.

"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6708002,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,358050,0.010562776938817712
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6741415,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'behavioral extinction', 'biological models', 'brain electronic stimulator', 'cerebellar Purkinje cell', 'cerebellar nuclei', 'cerebellum', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'electrophysiology', 'eye movements', 'laboratory rabbit', 'learning', 'microelectrodes', 'neural information processing', 'neural plasticity', 'neural transmission', 'neurons', 'operant conditionings', 'psychomotor function', 'reflex', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2004,222750,0.034283926553293355
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6792043,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2004,153537,0.053331648947466816
"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6768857,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2004,201825,0.005843915750845106

"Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of motor function due to accidental injury, stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, together with disorders of mental health, are the most crippling human ailments. One common result of mechanical insult is spinal cord injury (SCI), in which damage of the spinal cord by contusion, compression or laceration causes loss of sensation, motor and reflex function below the point of injury. Other symptoms of SCI may include bowel and bladder dysfunction, hyperalgesia and sexual dysfunction. Although many SCI patients survive injury, major chronic dysfunction is the most common outcome. There are approximately 10,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S each year. In contrast to the relatively small acute patient population, chronic SCI, involving approximately 200,000-250,000 people in this country, is extremely expensive to society, both in terms of human and economic costs. Because most SCI victims are under age 30 at the time of their injury, and most now live a near-normal life span, direct medical costs average $2 million per patient over a lifetime, and approximately $5 billion total per year in the US only. Therefore, any   drug or intervention that can positively improve the quality of life of patients suffering from SCI is likely to have a greater financial impact than would be expected simply from the cost of acute injury each year.  Animal models for SCI and other conditions that affect gait and motor coordination are successfully used today to develop new treatments. Assessing the level of motor dysfunction in an animal model is a difficult challenge as most researchers rely on the subjective scoring of symptoms. We propose here to build a system that will allow a more objective, faster and consistent assessment of the level of injury and course of recovery in rat and mouse models of SCI that can be applied in the future to other gait and motor coordination disorders. An artificial intelligent system based on computer vision will be developed to capture and score gait and motor coordination in rodents and will be validated against the standard scores of motor function obtained using the methods of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (1995) for the rat model of SCI.         n/a",Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function,6695163,R43NS046980,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gait', ' laboratory rat', ' limb movement', ' psychomotor function', ' spinal cord injury']",NINDS,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2003,234554,0.03660352275342942

"Neurological Control During Brain Recording  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal aims to investigate the optimal design features of intracortical motor neuroprosthetics by analyzing: 1) The ability of specific algorithms to predict movements from neural activity, 2) the ability of non-human primate subjects to control neurally-derived signals in a behaviorally useful way, and 3) explore the abilities of humans to control computer cursors with neural activity. First, discrete and continuous movement models will be evaluated to determine the minimum amount of data necessary to build robust decoders. This relates to clinical calibration: How much time will be required for patients to build decoding models that they can then use? Next, I will evaluate if and how animals can control a computer cursor whose position is driven by decoded neural activity alone: Whether they can generate stationary holds, ballistic reaches, and complex trajectories. Finally, I will test the decoding system in humans by participating in ongoing human multi-electrode recording. I hope to implement a real-time neural activity decoding system to test whether human subjects can rapidly acquire useful, accurate control over a movement signal. These investigations will shed light on which parameters are useful for achieving such control and yield insight on the optimal balance between computer and human learning in the closed-loop control system to restore maximum functional independence.   n/a",Neurological Control During Brain Recording,6583494,F31NS045460,"['Macaca', ' artificial intelligence', ' assistive device /technology', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomechanics', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electrodes', ' functional ability', ' goal oriented behavior', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' medical rehabilitation related tag', ' nervous system prosthesis', ' neurophysiology', ' neuroregulation', ' predoctoral investigator']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F31,2003,37017,0.0019584522637237974
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6639065,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2003,223063,0.034283926553293355
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6688775,R21NS045410,"[""Parkinson's disease"", ' abnormal involuntary movement', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' electromyography', ' human subject', ' method development', ' neuromuscular disorder', ' psychomotor function', ' tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2003,178485,0.053331648947466816
"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6671314,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' learning', ' light intensity', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' sensory discrimination', ' sensory signal detection', ' visual feedback', ' visual perception', ' visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2003,229705,0.005843915750845106
"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution.

"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity,6529645,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', ' artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' cadmium', ' calcium', ' calcium channel', ' computer simulation', ' epilepsy', ' gap junctions', ' hippocampus', ' magnesium', ' model design /development', ' neuropharmacology', ' veratrum alkaloid', ' voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,229500,0.013180959913002464
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6516620,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,358050,0.010562776938817712

"Artificial Neural Network modelling for studying posture A major challenge with the application of artificial neural network (ANN) modeling in examining the motor-sensory relation in postural control is that the neural synaptic weights that relate the inputs to the outputs of the ANN are chaotic in nature. In an earlier study through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experimental tests, the PI and her colleague have found that these weights are interdependent. The product of these weights is a statistically stable variable and can be used to quantify the input-output relation of the ANN, called Q value. The objective of this proposed research is to extend the above work to the area of human postural control. Specifically, we will explore whether or not a Q value concept in an ANN can be used to quantify the motor-sensory relation in a classical postural control task - maintaining upright balance when the supporting base is suddenly rotated in a toes up direction. We will construct an ANN model that includes two outputs and seven inputs. The two outputs are the EMG signals from ankle dorsiflexor and plantartlexor in response to the onset of the supporting base rotation. The seven inputs are average eye-target distance (distance from eye center to a visual target), head acceleration (both linear and angular), ankle joint rotation, ankle joint rotation speed, and ground reaction forces (both normal and shear) under feet. These inputs represent the mechanical stimulation to the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems, respectively. These inputs and outputs variables will be measured directly from two groups of elderly subjects: peripherally neuropathic and normal, non-peripherally neuropathic. We will then determine the weights in the ANN model by a backward-propagation training routine, and the corresponding Q values relating each output to each of the inputs. We will statistically compare the Q values among the multiple sensory inputs within each group. We hypothesize that under this experimental condition, the Q values relating postural muscle activities to the somatosensory inputs would be: (1) significantly higher than the Q values relating to other sensory inputs (such as visual and vestibular inputs) in normal, non-neuropathic subjects; and (2) significantly lower than the Q values relating to other sensory inputs in neuropathic subjects. It is hoped that this study will contribute to our understanding of how sensory information is used to control postural muscle activities, and how a modification in the motor-sensory relation can result in increased postural stability or falls.  n/a",Artificial Neural Network modelling for studying posture,6400894,R03AG019872,"['artificial intelligence', ' balance', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' posture', ' psychomotor function', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' vestibular pathway', ' visual pathways']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R03,2001,75500,0.01783071870082675
"Analysis & Control of NonSynaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of NonSynaptic Epileptiform Activity,6383308,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', ' artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' cadmium', ' calcium', ' calcium channel', ' computer simulation', ' epilepsy', ' gap junctions', ' hippocampus', ' magnesium', ' model design /development', ' neuropharmacology', ' veratrum alkaloid', ' voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,224388,0.013096142329864047

Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.

Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.

"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6331594,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,358050,0.010562776938817712
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6327522,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2001,249250,0.034283926553293355
"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI.

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury.

"CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation The discovery that aberrant synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity recorded in PD patients is suppressed by DBS has advanced the concept that measures associated with pathological activity may be used as biomarkers to control the delivery of DBS therapy. Pilot studies of aDBS in PD have reported promising clinical results from triggering DBS stimulation when the signal recorded from the DBS electrode showed a high level of oscillatory power in the beta frequency range (13 – 35 Hz). That approach, however, has important limitations. Most importantly, beta power recorded from the DBS lead is suppressed by movement including PD tremor, its detection is highly dependent on lead location and the recording montage needed to record during stimulation is incompatible with directional current steering, a recent innovation employing segmented stimulation contacts. The inherent complexity of the increased parameter space through DBS innovations also overwhelms standard programming techniques. Finally, use of additional biomarker signals (e.g., recorded from cortex) is likely to improve the ability to adaptively control DBS for disorders marked by complex multidimensional symptomatologies such as PD. The current proposal will establish methods for overcoming these limitations by developing techniques for multi-feature classification from ECoG recordings, using advanced machine learning algorithms. The proposed research builds upon the extensive and unique experiences with multi-day, extra-operative recording from DBS leads in patients at Charité Hospital and intraoperative ECoG and DBS recording from patients at the University of Pittsburgh, in order to develop computational methods to advance closed-loop, adaptive DBS (aDBS) strategies for movement disorders. This research seeks to improve computational methods for interpreting brain signals recorded from patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. The results may inform the design of novel strategies for biomarker-responsive brain stimulation.",CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,10025184,R01NS110424,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Berlin', 'Biological Markers', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor behavior', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'reduce symptoms', 'remote sensor', 'symptomatology', 'translational neuroscience']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,221735,0.02214757476314968
"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move,10094597,R01NS119268,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Extensor', 'Flexor', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Hindlimb', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lateral', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor Pathways', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Proprioceptor', 'Quality of life', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord posterior horn', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cutaneous sensory neurons', 'electrical property', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'motor behavior', 'motor function improvement', 'mouse genetics', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'vibration']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,433281,0.06403498835023436
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles.

"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,9952827,K99NS115919,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'multitask', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,136242,0.004146066619538402
"Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Over 5 million people in the USA – nearly 1 person in 50 – live with a form of paralysis due to causes including stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and ALS. People who have lost the ability to move also lose a profound sense of control, freedom, and independence in their lives. But paralysis does not take away one's intent or desire to move; the brain still encodes these thoughts through neural signals. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore the ability to communicate with the world by translating these neural signals into actions. BMIs decode neural signals into the movements of a computer cursor on a screen or a robotic arm, allowing the user to interact with the world autonomously. While BMIs have existed for over two decades, they have remained in pilot clinical trials dating back to 2004 and have not achieved widespread use. The key reason for this is that BMI performance has not achieved levels of performance that overcome their costs and risks. This is true for both invasive BMIs requiring neurosurgery, as well as for non-invasive BMIs, which can be used without surgical procedures but achieve low performance. This proposal aims to dramatically increase the quality of life for millions with paralysis by making widely accessi- ble BMIs available within the next ﬁve years. To achieve this groundbreaking goal, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way BMIs fundamentally operate. Revolutionary next generation BMIs making signiﬁcant impact must be designed to: (1) achieve categorically unprecedented performance not possible with current BMI systems (e.g., over an order of magnitude improvement) and (2) minimize cost to patients, ideally being non-invasive. En- tirely novel BMI architectures are needed to fundamentally transcend a performance vs cost trade-off, achieving excellent performance at lower risks and costs. To meet this need, I propose to develop a next-generation BMI where the user and an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) agent synergistically cooperate. We term this an “AI-BMI.” The AI agent predicts the user's intended motor actions and synergistically helps to complete them. Critically, the AI agent aids the precise and detailed execution of the user's intended movements, augmenting performance. By doing so, this architecture fundamentally changes the design objectives of BMIs from neural decoding of precise movements (difﬁcult) to behavioral and neural inference of the user's intent (easier). Non-invasive AI-BMIs, if successful, would be transformative, enabling next generation BMI technology that allows people with paralysis to once again move, but mitigates medical risks associated with neurosurgery and lowers system costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, brain- mahince interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain to control prosthetic devices. The proposed work aims to create and optimize a new class of transformative BMIs that incorporate an external artiﬁcial intelligence agent who infers the user's intent and helps to carry out prosthesis actions. If successful, these new BMIs would signiﬁcantly increase BMI performance while lowering risks and costs, enabling widespread use.",Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence,10003004,DP2NS122037,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Medical', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Transcend', 'Translating', 'Work', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'cost', 'design', 'intelligent agent', 'neurosurgery', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2020,2340000,0.01199291233302656
"Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema The goal of this proposed research is to reveal the sensory origins underlying the body schema representation. Body schema is the brain's internal model of the body's spatial configuration. This internal representation is critical for sensorimotor processing, movement control, and self-awareness, and is continuously updated during movement. Body schema representations are disrupted when somatosensory input is lost. The first step toward discover the neural correlates of body schema is to uncover neural mechanisms that generate body posture representation. We hypothesize that sensory inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are transformed to construct a body posture representation.  To delineate the mechanisms underlying the neural coding of body posture, this project will utilize large- scale monitoring, apply interventional tools, develop new data analysis tools, and integrate new approaches. Our approach is to perform large-scale electrophysiological recording and novel markerless tracking of 3D posture in freely moving mice. To track posture, the first aim is to adapt a markerless tracking pipeline comprised of a deep 3D convolutional neural network to process high-speed videography of mouse behavior from multiple cameras. The second aim is to perform large-scale recording of neurons in S1, S2, and PPC and use advanced computational approaches to determine which postural features best explain the activity of neurons in these cortical areas. Finally, the third aim is to use optogenetic and projection-specific manipulations to address the causal impact of proprioceptive inputs from S1 and S2 on coding of posture in PPC. This research promises to uncover how sensory inputs are involved in generating the body schema representation and guiding behavior.  Extensive training will be required to carry out this project and achieve my goal of earning a tenure-track professor position. The rigorous methodological and intellectual environment in Dr. Fan Wang’s lab and the Duke Neurobiology community will advance my conceptual knowledge and technical skills. I will implement deep learning techniques through training and collaboration with specialists. I will learn new techniques by attending Neuropixel and computational neuroscience courses. Finally, I will develop my professional skills by frequent attendance of seminars, workshops, and meeting with a postdoctoral mentorship committee.  The proposed project will be conducted in the Department of Neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Campus. This interdisciplinary community at Duke will bolster the research and training included in this application through frequent interaction with talented and collaborative faculty, organization of seminars and symposia, numerous opportunities to practice research talks and receive valuable feedback, formation of a personalized postdoctoral mentorship committee, extensive career and professional training, and invaluable support from the postdoctoral association. Project Narrative Body schema, the brain’s internal model of the spatial configuration of its body parts, is normally updated during movement, but can be disrupted following amputation, stroke, or deafferentation. Understanding how neural circuits generate body schema representation in health and disease could pave the way for improvements in surgical practice, stroke recovery therapy, brain-machine interface technology, and prosthetic limb engineering. Furthermore, sustaining an internal model of the body is a key element of awareness of one’s own body and the body of others, so findings on the sensory origins underlying body schema will have implications ranging from sensorimotor processing, motor control, interpersonal representations, and social cognition.",Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema,9987939,F32MH122995,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Analyses', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Experimental Models', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Self Perception', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'research to practice', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,37289,8.241872368163358e-05
"Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior ABSTRACT Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain. Exploratory behaviors are necessary for rodent survival in the natural world and ubiquitous in freely-moving rodent experiments. One neural circuit that may mediate natural exploratory behaviors are the projections from prelimbic cortex (PL, part of rodent prefrontal cortex) to ventral tegmental area (VTA). Stimulation of PL-VTA projections causes increased velocity but is not rewarding, despite the well-known rewarding effect of direct stimulation of VTA-dopamine neurons. Taken together with the fact that VTA has been implicated in exploration, my central hypothesis is that PL-VTA neurons mediate natural exploratory behaviors through downstream effects on a subpopulation of non-dopaminergic VTA neurons. To investigate this hypothesis, I will first develop an unbiased, machine-learning-based method to quantify untrained, freely-moving mouse behaviors (Experiment 1.1). My method will leverage multi-view, high resolution video, supervised body part tracking, and unsupervised machine learning-based postural clustering methods. I will use this method to identify which specific behaviors (rearing, walking, grooming, sniffing, etc.) are affected by optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of PL-VTA cells in the presence and absence of rewards (Experiment 1.2). Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of my behavioral quantification method and suggests that PL-VTA stimulation increases exploratory behaviors. Next, to identify the genetically- and target-defined VTA cells that are preferentially synapsed onto by PL projections, I will use a combination of optogenetics, in vitro electrophysiology, transgenic mice, and retrograde tracing. First, I will use transgenic mice to measure the functional strength of PL input specifically onto VTA cells that are dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic (Experiment 2.1). In a different set of mice, I will use retrograde tracing to identify if PL synapses preferentially onto VTA cells that project to nucleus accumbens or amygdala (Experiment 2.2). After learning which genetic and target-defined VTA subpopulations receive PL input, I will use retrograde tracing in combination with transgenic labeling to identify specifically which genetically and projection-defined VTA subpopulation receives PL input (Experiment 2.3). Finally, I will use a retrograde cre-dependent virus to selectively infect this VTA subpopulation with ChR2 and use my behavioral quantification pipeline to investigate whether in vivo stimulation of this subpopulation recapitulates the exploratory effects of PL-VTA stimulation (Experiment 2.4). Thus, the project proposed will develop a novel method for quantifying naturalistic behavior and integrate this computational method with diverse experimental methods, including in vivo and in vitro optogenetics, natural behavior, and synaptic physiology. These experiments will contribute novel information on how the PL-VTA circuit mediates naturalistic motor output, independent of the reinforcement effects of VTA-dopamine activity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain, but until recently methods for quantifying spontaneous behavior have been limited. I will develop a novel computational method for assessing how naturalistic exploratory behaviors are mediated by a subset of prefrontal cortex cells and the midbrain cells onto which they synapse. In total, this project will combine computational and experimental methods to map prefrontal-midbrain circuit and identify its effects on natural exploratory behavior.",Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior,10146550,F32MH125546,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Dopaminergic Cell', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Motor output', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Running', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Walking', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell cortex', 'cell type', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69926,-0.009850402557910806
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9984552,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2020,579461,0.03887549747077914
"Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo Project Summary Developing new methodological and analytical tools to address currently insurmountable experimental questions is crucial to the future of neuroscience. While recent advances in two-photon microscopy and activity sensors have revolutionized our understanding of the cellular and circuit basis of behavior, many barriers still exist that preclude fully exploring the molecular basis of these processes in vivo. This is an important question, as modulating synaptic strength is thought to underlie higher brain functions such as learning and memory, whereas synaptic degradation is observed in many neurological pathologies. Despite the clear significance of synaptic communication, a large-scale analysis of how synapses across the brain are distributed and change during learning has not been performed, mainly due to technical difficulties arising from the immensely complex nature of synaptic networks. Here, we present a suite of novel methodologies that breaks through these barriers. Our novel approach leverages CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins, in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize fluorescently tagged synapses in behaving animals, and deep-learning-based automatic synapse detection. Using these minimally invasive methods, we will be able to longitudinally track how the strength of millions of individual synapses change during learning. By developing and enabling new strategies to automatically detect and track vast numbers of synapses across entire brain regions, this pioneering approach has the potential to provide us with an unprecedented view of synapses in behaving animals, enabling new discoveries regarding how dynamic regulation of synaptic strength encodes learning and memory. Project Narrative This multi-disciplinary proposal leverages molecular labeling, machine learning, and in vivo microscopy to develop a suite of first-in-class tools to automatically detect synaptic plasticity in intact animals. By employing these novel tools we seek to explain how dynamic modulation of synaptic networks encodes learning and memory. Disruption of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be tightly associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases and the proposed research may reveal novel therapeutic approaches for several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease.",Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo,10009886,RF1MH123212,"['AMPA Receptors', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Investigation', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain volume', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'interest', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'open source', 'postsynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'synaptic function', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1757079,-0.009877504670033418
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9785611,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2020,601447,0.0014171869597240526
"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,-0.01902346155424443
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,10012952,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,134007,0.012188447099782597
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate.

"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile. Project Narrative Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the spinal cord neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. This project both identifies the spinal cord neural cell types and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9878145,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,530307,-0.005291596580441546
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation. Discovery in this area can  help improve understanding of neurologic disorders and development of new stimulation therapies. n/a",CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits,9978162,R01NS115327,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Closure by clamp', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventroposterior Medial Nucleus of the Thalamus', 'Vibrissae', 'awake', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'technology development', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,324660,-0.014980182288829387
"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Dystonia', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Human', 'Image', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'awake', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'in vivo', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,0.00028884396605691664
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Circuit dynamics of sensorimotor integration and decision making in octopus Project Summary  The goal of this proposal is to identify fundamental sensorimotor circuits associated with goal-oriented gripping movement by using high-dimensional biological, analytical and robotics technologies. To pursue this, we will study an animal that is extraordinary in many ways, the octopus.  Our interest in this unique invertebrate is based on its well documented complex behavior repertoire that have shown to resemble those of vertebrates. Each of the eight arms contains an axial nerve which functions like the vertebrate’s spinal cord. Previous work demonstrated that a severed octopus arm could exhibit movements that are almost identical to a goal-oriented movement that an intact octopus produces. This suggests that the octopus has a simplified neural program embedded within the arm itself and is adaptable to various degree of input from visual and motor brain areas. Thus, the octopus provides an unparalleled preparation to study central sensorimotor circuits associated with gripping behavior.  We will study the arm motion in the disembodied preparation (representing essentially a detached but functional vertebrate spinal cord) and in an intact, behaving octopus: We will use high-resolution cameras to characterize gripping motion in terms of velocity, trajectory and kinematics; We will develop technologies to wirelessly record multi-unit activity from the axial cord in locations proximate and distal to the brain; We will visualize neural activity in specific neural populations using GCaMP measurements; We will develop machine learning algorithms to link neural processes across multiple scales of structures and time, which will be essential to comparing data obtained from a disembodied arm to an intact arm. We will use the wealth of the multi-modal measurements for building a model-driven empirical design and validate these algorithms by computationally reproducing octopus arm movement and fashioning new movements; We will also test the biologically-inspired algorithms in an unprecedented approach: we will evoke gripping movement in a soft material-based biorobotic arm.  This novel research has the potential to bridge the gap between current BMI technologies and profound understanding of neural circuits associated with the gripping movement, that its impairment is most catastrophic and regaining this function is most desirable to patients. We expect that the sensorimotor circuits dynamics that we will discover will be later used to control locomotion and other adaptive movement in lower extremities. Additionally, this work will establish unparalleled new resources to the scientific community for studying unconventional species, and will fuel the developments of intelligent sensors, methods and frameworks to acquire high- dimensional biological data, and novel approaches to fabricate essential elements of soft robots to build the next generation of bionic limbs.

"Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity PROJECT SUMMARY Dexterous food-handling is a critical but still poorly understood type of basic motor behavior. We propose an exploratory research program to investigate how the mouse uses its digits and forepaws to dexterously handle food. Preliminary results suggest that mouse food-handling movements, despite appearing extremely complex, can be decomposed into several types of simpler elements, tentatively identified as distinct and very rapid submovements that exhibit partly stereotyped and partly variable kinematic features. They also suggest that the mouse’s thumb (first digit, or D1; pollex) plays a surprisingly large and previously unrecognized role in dexterous food-handling. To explore these hypotheses and observations, we will first develop an approach for quantitatively characterizing seed-handling behaviors of freely moving mice. For this we will use high-speed, close-up video capture, combined with deep neural network methods for automated markerless tracking (DeepLabCut). We will then develop a novel trial-based paradigm for characterizing seed-handling under the more experimentally controlled conditions of head-fixation. We will combine this approach with tools for optogenetic silencing of either selectively targeted cortical areas or selectively labeled corticospinal neurons in motor cortex, as well as multi- probe/multi-channel linear array recordings of spiking activity in key nodes along sensorimotor pathways. Collectively this work will advance our understanding of the elemental movements involved in the dexterous manipulation of food, providing new insights into this process in a genetically tractable model organism, and opening the way for future studies to dissect the cellular mechanisms in sensorimotor circuits mediating specific aspects of forelimb and digit motor control. NARRATIVE The proposed research on dexterous forelimb behavior is directly relevant to public health because pathology in the neural circuits that mediate these behaviors severely impairs motor control. By elucidating fundamental aspects of these behaviors in a model mammalian organism, the mouse, this research can lead to new treatments of disease, and is thus relevant to those aspects of the NIH mission aimed at improving health through understanding pathophysiological mechanisms in disorders causing disability.",Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity,9982480,R21NS116886,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Mastication', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'free behavior', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,434500,0.010606213315750145
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9977506,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,177444,-0.007103737568263088
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9914374,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,350000,0.015372822038428564
"Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control PROJECT SUMMARY Many mammals are distinguished by the exceptional diversity and agility of their limb movement. These qualities are critical to the fitness certain movements confer, and so to the evolutionary success of many species. While brain regions important for limb control have been identified, the neural signal processing that ultimately governs motor commands sent to muscles has remained stubbornly opaque. Mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement are thus lacking. This obscures the etiology of motor deficits caused by neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatments.  A primary cause of this opacity of motor system processing is the ambiguity of the basic functional elements comprising relevant neural circuits. An emerging view posits that these elements may be neuronal subtypes defined by features like axonal target region, target cell identity, and gene expression. Yet the fundamental question of what are the appropriate cellular features for defining functional units remains unanswered. This ambiguity stems from a host of technical limitations. We expect that functionally salient neuronal subtypes will make characteristic contributions to specific phases of movement. Yet traditional methods for silencing neural activity to assess function lack the temporal resolution to discern such specific influence. We also expect that functionally salient subtypes will exhibit distinct activity patterns and interactions with other neuronal populations. But classical methods for measuring neural firing are typically blind to key cellular features. Moreover, the behavioral paradigms used for motor system studies have not captured essential aspects of natural mammalian movement, for which motor system organization may have been adapted over evolution.  Fortunately though, systems neuroscience is currently being revolutionized by advances in physiological, genetic, and computational techniques. I plan to leverage many of these advances and pursue an innovative approach to resolve the basic functional elements within a model motor system population – the subcerebral projection neurons (SPNs) found in motor areas of the neocortex. We will employ a naturalistic climbing paradigm for mice engineered in my lab to overcome limitations of previous motor behavior paradigms. New genetically- mediated targeting strategies will provide access to potential functional subtypes for activity measurement and perturbation. We will novelly couple optogenetic probes, electromyography, and automated behavior decomposition to distinguish precise phases of neuronal subtype influence. Large-scale, multi-area activity recording, optogenetic identification, and machine learning will parse subtypes by their activity and interactions with other neuronal populations. Our work will articulate an interdisciplinary approach applicable to the fundamental question of functional units in other neural systems as well. The mechanistic insight our work begins to build will help elucidate the etiology of movement deficits stemming from conditions like ALS and Huntington’s disease, and following stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project aims to identify basic functional elements within motor circuits to help build mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement execution. The lack of such models has sharply limited our understanding of the etiology of motor deficits stemming from neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatment. The mechanistic insight our work builds will thus help elucidate the etiology of motor deficits and facilitate improved treatment.","Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control",10002981,DP2NS120847,"['Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Computational Technique', 'Development', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Huntington Disease', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'blind', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'stem', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,DP2,2020,2340462,0.03596582159783366
"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,9976609,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1275271,0.04141682929394368
"Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes life-long neurological impairment, and there is currently no effective treatment. The premise of this proposal is recent work demonstrating that afferent stimulation paired with treadmill training can enhance standing, stepping, and volitional control in humans and animal models. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms by which afferent stimulation drives motor improvement. Tools that can identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient to enhance recovery, and that can facilitate characterization of the helpful neural plasticity, are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop approaches for selective afferent modulation, and apply them to the dissection of the mechanisms underlying recovery from SCI. The objective of this grant is to identify which sets of afferents are important for recovery and how spinal circuits change to facilitate it. To achieve selective modulation of afferents and enable genetic tracing we will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that can modulate excitability in specific populations of neurons. To accurately quantify improvement, we will use Deep Learning to analyze large kinematic data sets. Our preliminary data shows strong expression of DREADDs in large diameter DRG neurons, that their activation by CNO can excite or inhibit the H-reflex, and that activation of excitatory DREADDs during treadmill training post-SCI improves stepping. Our main hypothesis is that activation of large afferents by the excitatory DREADD (hM3Dq) during treadmill training will enhance recovery, whereas inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) will suppress recovery. Four sub- hypotheses will test whether recovery is mediated by increased afferent projection onto 1) motor neurons, or 2) inhibitory interneurons; or by sprouting of 3) reticulospinal and 4) propriospinal circuits. Our Specific Aims are to determine whether selective expression of DREADDs in (Aim 1) all large diameter (proprioceptive and tactile) neurons and (Aim 2) large proprioceptive afferents only can enhance recovery. The rationale for these aims is that afferent stimulation is hypothesized to work through selective excitation of large diameter sensory afferents (LDSA) that both drive motor pools locally and facilitate proprio- and surpraspinal input. To date, it has not been possible to definitively determine which afferents were recruited after electrical stimulation, or to select between afferents of similar diameter. The significance of this work lies in determining whether recovery is mediated exclusively by proprioceptive axons or a combination of proprioceptive and tactile afferents, and uncovering the mechanisms of functional plasticity in the spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 300,000 individuals are living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the USA without an effective treatment. Recently, spinal cord stimulation during rehabilitation has been found to enable better standing, stepping, and voluntary control in patients with SCI. This study will improve our understanding of these mechanisms by 1) using new genetic tools to identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient for improvement, and 2) using genetic tracing techniques to uncover how spinal circuits are changing to enhance function.",Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury,10051492,R01NS114007,"['Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Caliber', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dissection', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'H-Reflex', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outcome', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Synapses', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toes', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'density', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'effective therapy', 'feeding', 'functional plasticity', 'human model', 'improved', 'injury recovery', 'kinematics', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'sensory input', 'tool', 'treadmill training', 'vector']",NINDS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,416293,0.02595647770216884
"Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex Project Summary/Abstract: For animals to execute complicated behaviors, successful motor planning and execution is essential. Moreover, the sequence of events leading to successful goal-based behavior takes place over a wide range of timescales. For example, when walking from home to work, one must first make an abstract, long-timescale decision to go to work, which much then be translated into a sequence of shorter-timescale right-left turning decisions, which are translated into the finely fluctuating electrical patterns that control the muscles. How motor planning and execution occur simultaneously over many timescales in populations of motor cortex neurons is not well understood. Much work in humans and nonhuman primates have shown that visual and auditory stimuli integrate over multiple timescales. This work has shown that early sensory regions, like primary visual cortex, respond to fast fluctuations in the environment. This information is integrated to longer-timescale information in secondary cortical regions, with the longest- timescale information in frontal and association areas. We therefore hypothesize that secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons control behavior over longer timescales than primary motor cortex (M1) neurons. To study this phenomenon, I have built a setup in which head-fixed mice navigate in virtual reality to a rewarded location. In this setup, I can record video from all sides of the animal for high spatiotemporal resolution measurement of motor behaviors. I have developed machine learning algorithms to extract 3D pose data from these videos. In Aim 1, I will use calcium imaging to record large numbers of neurons in mouse M1 and M2 to correlate the activity of individual neurons and populations to the animal’s ongoing pose kinematics. We will supplement with targeted silicon probe recordings to capture fast neural responses. In Aim 2, I will compare the calcium dynamics in populations of M1 and M2 neurons in mice trained to perform a virtual motor planning task versus mice that have not been trained. We hypothesize that training to plan motor actions increases the timescale of M1/M2 neural activity. In Aim 3, we will use optogenetic silencing in specific regions of cortex to perturb the animal’s motor behavior. We hypothesize that the duration of the perturbed movements will be longer when M2 is perturbed than M1. In this way, we will study how different cortical regions relate to behavior over many timescales. This proposal will broaden our knowledge of cortical processing in general, and motor planning and execution in particular. Patients with mental illness, such as ADHD, autism, and Asperger’s disorder show impaired ability to plan upcoming movements. The first step to successfully treating these illnesses is to better understand how motor planning occurs in general. Project Narrative: This proposal will elucidate how motor planning and execution take place simultaneously, over many timescales, and across brain regions. Better understanding motor planning will help generate new treatments for diseases that affect motor planning, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.",Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex,10007591,F31NS108450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Asperger Syndrome', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Stereotyping', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'area striata', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'frontal lobe', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2020,33236,0.04778312147267496
"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,9962505,R01NS081118,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dysarthria', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Essential Tremor', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Harmaline', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paresthesia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Radiation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Utah', 'Work', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'motor symptom', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'research study', 'side effect', 'somatosensory', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'zona incerta']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,549049,0.005441241625546796
"Impaired Astroglial Glutamate Signaling in Rett Syndrome ABSTRACT  Rett syndrome (RTT) is a leading cause of severe intellectual disability in women. Individuals with RTT develop  typically  until

start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the X-­linked transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2 (MECP2) occur in >95% of RTT cases. Initially, MeCP2 deficiency in neurons was considered as the exclusive

"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9930683,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2020,2983524,-0.012112993214468402
"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,9996149,R01NS117058,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Homeobox', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'STN stimulation', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Solid', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'motor deficit', 'motor recovery', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'translation to humans']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,641051,0.011192994536080069
"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,10214202,K00NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'post stroke', 'posters', 'powered exoskeleton', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K00,2020,72598,0.01910430267366493
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,9991417,F32MH123012,"['ARNT gene', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Cloning', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73010,0.001038226693138728
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,10002297,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,284005,0.0034718755628003295
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.0438715203456553
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9932509,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,615717,0.030573738081878462
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9983219,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1025216,-0.004104758395902802
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,9971314,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10034533,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured form', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analog', 'animal safety', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'commercialization', 'conditioning', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional functioning', 'first-in-human', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'nanofabrication', 'neural circuit', 'neurotechnology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety testing', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trigonometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,885873,0.00041853810920966386
