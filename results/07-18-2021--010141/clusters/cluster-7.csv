"Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the natural acoustic environment. They adapt their hearing to emphasize the features of sound that are important for making behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. A better understanding of the function of the healthy and impaired auditory system will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will develop computational tools to study central auditory processing. A software library will support fitting and evaluating a large number of encoding models to describe the functional relationship between a time-varying natural auditory stimulus and the corresponding neural response. Many such models have been proposed, but relatively few direct comparisons have been made between them. This project will enable their comparison, allowing identification of the key features that contribute positively to their performance. The system will have a modular design so that useful elements from different models can be combined into comprehensive models with even greater explanatory power. The software will be open source and will support data from multiple recording modalities, including small-scale single unit electrophysiological and calcium imaging data, as well as large-scale local field and magnetoencephalography data. In addition to building on existing hypotheses about neural coding, the system will support machine learning methods for fitting artificial neural network models using the same datasets. These large, data-driven models have proven valuable for wide ranging signal processing problems, but their value and relation to existing models for neural sensory processing remain to be explored. Sensory processing involves coherent activity of large neural populations. To study coding at the population level, the system will support models that characterize the simultaneous activity of multiple neural signals and identifies latent subspaces of population activity related to sound encoding. Sensory coding is also influenced by behavioral context, reflecting changes in behavioral demands and the more general environment. The system will incorporate behavioral state variables into models, where encoding properties can be modulated by changes in behavioral context. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the neural populations in the healthy brain represent complex natural sounds. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales,9774688,R01EB028155,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual system structure', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'computerized tools', 'data format', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open source', 'receptive field', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIBIB,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,794000,0.05417233225644526
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,9765324,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,254496,0.024643430063190617
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9730628,R01NS091421,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,381916,0.07803333541815127
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9665785,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,403711,0.04453849444195112
"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9803507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,334599,0.021766705870704405
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9735214,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'summer internship', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,268961,0.08569002643312562
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients. Our results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.",Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity,9654724,R01DC016915,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Problem Solving', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cortex mapping', 'electric field', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'operation', 'programs', 'semantic processing', 'sound', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,601029,0.10256329277226318
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9634046,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,327250,0.11111701757779503
"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice.

"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9797408,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,337875,0.08539204992303266
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,9872014,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2019,126090,0.03354808658497378
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects.

"From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the gap Recent advances in experimental technology promise rapid progress in developing a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuit structure, at the synaptic scale, leads to complex sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors. Volume EM techniques have advanced to the point that neural tissue can be imaged at synaptic resolution in volumes large enough (~ 100 Âµm) to contain a entire small neuron . Innovations in machine learning approaches to analyzing these EM images have now permitted automated segmentation of these into 3D representations of every neuronal process within the volume. However, significant technical challenges remain to improve EM acquisition and analysis methods to the point of achieving the millimeter-scale volumes required to reconstruct neuronal assemblies underlying complex behaviors. Tools are needed to improve the reliability of EM systems for the acquisition of such large datasets. Automated methods to identify the cell-type of segmented neurites and to characterize the firing patterns of neurons prior to EM imaging are also needed, as are software tools to query and visualize the resulting rich 3D datasetsâessentially allowing neuroscientists to carry out âvirtual experiments.â Here we propose to develop a set of tools to address each of these problems. These tools will be developed in the context of the songbird, a powerful model organism to study the neural circuits underlying the production and learning of a complex vocal/motor behavior. Neural recordings in singing birds of every known cell type in cortical, thalamic, and basal ganglia circuits, have led to mechanistic circuit-level hypotheses, which in turn make clear and testable predictions about the ultrastructure of neural circuits. The proposed tools would allow neuroscientists to bridge the gap from vEM data to the virtuous circle of hypothesis driven anatomical experimentation, and data-inspired hypotheses.

"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9536330,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,407497,0.04453849444195112
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9526901,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2018,281216,0.08569002643312562
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9408628,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,327250,0.11111701757779503

"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice. We will test this system on multiple mouse models of auditory spectrum disorders to uncover novel covariation in the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological phenotypes.",High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice,9601457,R21MH116450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'House mice', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Linux', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Raspberries', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensory', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wild Animals', 'Work', 'animal model development', 'auditory processing', 'base', 'behavior test', 'flexibility', 'gene discovery', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2018,209328,0.040895907392214624
"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjectsâ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain areaâs causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER.

"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology No abstract available Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments â and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,9681144,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2018,58282,0.046585969341732245
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9310363,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,363754,0.07803333541815127
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9301514,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2017,293470,0.08569002643312562
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement) Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts.

"Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuronâs function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles underlying cerebellar circuits. We will use large-scale electron microscopy to extract cerebellar network anatomy.

"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjectsâ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain areaâs causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general. Narrative: Identifying emotion in speech is a critical brain process required for social interaction and is impaired in many neuropsychiatric diseases.

Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, as well as improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. While much has been learned about the loci of language-related processing using non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans, these techniques cannot answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. As a result, the explicit cellular circuit-level and neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing are poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language, in particular the processing of temporal patterns within communication signals. The experiments outlined in this proposal investigate the neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent speech sounds (phonemes) can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Sensitivity to transition statistics is not exclusive to speech signals however, but reflects general auditory processes shared by many animals. In Aim 1 we investigate the categorical perception of complex auditory objects in populations of cortical neurons in an animal model, and ask how these neural representations are effected by temporal context. In addition to which elements occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Studies in Aim 2 focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. In Aim 3, we propose a basic circuit in which population level representations of auditory objects could be differentially modulated by patterning rules, and test this proposed pattern processing circuit using direct, casual manipulations. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern perception,9527903,R56DC016408,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transition Elements', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language processing', 'microstimulation', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2017,363607,0.02063132875803189
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9136881,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,352019,0.07803333541815127
"The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states Abstract  In the last decade it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression play an important role in brain function and dysfunction. Disruption in neuroepigenetic developmental processes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation result in mental retardation and cognitive impairments. More recently, neuroepigenetic processes have also been implicated in adult behaviors, such as addiction and memory. This opens the possibility that these mechanisms may be able to control the establishment and maintenance of behavioral states. However, the underlying mechanisms through which neuroepigenetic processes can mediate changes in circuit excitability to determine behavioral states remain mysterious. Moreover, because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, and the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific circuits. This presents a major roadblock towards unlocking the interface between brain and environment and their role in human health and disease. Here we propose a three-prong solution to this problem by using: a brain that shows conserved neurochemistry and neuroepigenetic mechanisms, but with orders of magnitude fewer neurons and homogenous circuits compared to mammalian brains, behaviors that are regulated by the environment (hunger and satiety), and an environment that is experimentally controllable (fasting vs. re-feeding; normal diet vs. high sugar diet). Changes in the excitability and plasticity of conserved circuits determine outputs feeding states like hunger and satiety. These changes occur slow, are persistent over hours, depend on the physiological state and are bidirectional. Thus, they could be encoded neuroepigenetically to alter the expression of key genes important to modulate circuit excitability. Furthermore, because a large number of metabolism intermediates functions as cofactors for chromatin modifying enzymes, physiological changes in metabolites and nutrients can directly alter gene expression. My lab has pioneered techniques and established unique collaborations to address the functional role of neuroepigenetic processes in regulating the activity of specific circuits in the context of feeding states. We propose to map how environmental inputs act on chromatin and gene expression to direct the changes in neuronal excitability that underlie output feeding behaviors. First, we will identify the specific chromatin pathways that act in a unique circuit important to switch the behavioral state of the fly between hungry and sated. We will then map the functional genetic loci of integration between physiological state and output behavioral states by examining the occupancy of these pathways on chromatin and their effect on behavior and neural activity. We will then dissect how changes in environmental input (energy scarcity in fasting, energy availability in re-feeding, and energy surplus in a high sugar diet) directly affect gene expression by altering the activity of these pathways and their genetic loci of integration. To this end, we will work with analytical chemists to develop new methods to measure changes in metabolites in the blood, brain and specific circuits and with computational biologists to harness machine learning analysis to integrate metabolism and gene expression datasets to identify the molecular pathways that act at the interface between input and effector mechanisms to regulate output behavioral states. Because the endocrine and physiological changes that underlie hunger and satiety are evolutionary conserved, our approach will provide a model of how the environment can functionally determine bidirectional, flip-flop behavioral states through neuroepigenetic mechanisms. More broadly, these studies will uncover how epigenetic mechanisms may function as gatekeepers of âbehavioral statesâ (normal and abnormal), to provide the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the âconditioningâ effect of environments (from nutrients to maternal care) on neural plasticity. Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed study will identify how nutrients in diet play a key role in regulating hunger and satiety states by changing neuronal activity and behavior. This will pave the way to understanding how the increased consumption of calories is linked to diseases such as depression, cancer, aging and neurodegeneration. More broadly, these experiments will identify in detail the molecular and physiological adaptations of a cellular system to a changing environment, develop new methodologies to study metabolism, and computational tool to integrate large orthogonal gene expression and metabolism datasets.",The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states,9167992,DP2DK113750,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data Set', 'Developmental Process', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fasting', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Functional disorder', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hunger', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Adaptation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'brain behavior', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'conditioning', 'feeding', 'fly', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'neurochemistry', 'neuronal excitability', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sugar']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,DP2,2016,2009885,0.016220987342485026
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9090040,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2016,293470,0.08569002643312562
"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,9109046,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive task', 'combinatorial', 'connectome', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'mental function', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,313000,0.07498705104519146
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9005185,R01DC014950,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,327250,0.11111701757779503
"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.                ",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9030044,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'light microscopy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,340627,0.07803333541815127
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative. The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.",High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits,8856373,R01NS076467,"['2 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Fast Electron', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nanometer', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'young adult']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,1543491,0.08782683172279787

"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9047911,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2015,311320,0.08569002643312562
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. To make focused progress, we will undertake a comprehensive integration of experiments and computational models of the structure and function of whole-brain circuits in transparent fish experiencing virtual reality.","Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity",8935965,U01NS090449,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Fishes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Plastics', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Receptors', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,952773,0.06666481341087718
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.

"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2).

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function. Our procedures and analysis will mitigate many of the difficulties that have limited our ability to discern the structre and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.                ",Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits,8827174,U01NS090595,"['Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Comparative Anatomy', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Embryonic Development', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Group Meetings', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Jaw', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neck', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nociception', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smell Perception', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Taste Perception', 'Technology', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tongue', 'Touch sensation', 'Trigeminal System', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'feeding', 'image processing', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'nerve stem cell', 'orofacial', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'vocalization']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2014,851597,0.07264439483904055
"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.

"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8722888,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2014,8990,0.04624759293253342
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.                ",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8639755,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,313000,0.07498705104519146
"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease.

First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease. We propose to develop a universal way to discover how genes work together in circuits, eventually leading to better diagnosis and therapy.             n/a",Center for Cell Circuits,8116814,P50HG006193,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Explosion', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome Components', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'embryonic stem cell', 'frontier', 'gene discovery', 'genetic profiling', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",P50,2011,3674343,0.08327143494664298
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.           The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction.

"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote âblue skyâ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. SCAN will leverage these advantages to foster growth and innovation tied to core missions of the National Institutes of Deafness and Communication Disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) has a strong connection to deafness and communication disorders through its focus on the basic science of human cognitive auditory neuroscience, and its translation. SCAN will establish an intellectual home for dissemination of cutting-edge research in human cognitive auditory neuroscience, support the development of the next generation of scientists, build a vibrant and inclusive community that engages with the grand challenges in the field, and forge new academia-industry partnerships.",SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN),9914387,R13DC018243,"['Academia', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Atmosphere', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fertilization', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Joint Ventures', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Otolaryngology', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'deafness', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'millisecond', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open data', 'posters', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'symposium', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,36183,0.04789102172585424
"Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit Work on learning in neural systems has focused largely on the effects of plasticity at synapses that provide direct input to the neurons being studied. Learning a model of the environment or a complex skill, however, relies on plasticity that is widely distributed and may occur at synapses far from the neurons driving decisions or actions. As is well-known from multi-layer (or 'deep') artificial networks, distributing learning over multiple layers is substantially more powerful but also more difficult to implement than learning at a single layer. The fact that computer scientists have solved such problems has revolutionized artificial intelligence and is rapidly reshaping the human world. Understanding how the brain solves such problems is, undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience today. However, progress along these lines has been slow, due in part to the high degree of complexity of learning and memory circuits in mammals, such as hippocampus and neocortex, that have been a major focus of research. This proposal applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to a system with unique advantages for understanding learning in multi-layer networks. The electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish is the site of a continual learning process that predicts and cancels self-generated sensory input in order to enhance detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Building on this knowledge, we propose to develop a model of the ELL spanning from cellular biophysics to network dynamics with the goal of explaining how synaptic plasticity widely distributed across processing layers and cell types gives rise to learning. To accomplish this, we will leverage cutting-edge approaches for mapping synaptic connectivity at high-resolution and monitoring neural population activity over the entire time course of learning. The proposed research is expected to yield general insight into how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. This proposal seeks to understand how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. To do this we will apply cutting-edge approaches for measuring activity in neuronal populations, mapping circuitry at high-resolution, and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model systemâthe weakly electric mormryid fish. The research will produce a detailed computational model, spanning from biophysical to network levels, of how learning arises from synaptic plasticity that is widely distributed across processing layers and cell types.",Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit,10053457,R01NS118448,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mormyridae', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'skills']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1521512,0.02355275647349767
"Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue Abstract  How is connectivity between neurons related to patterns of activity exhibited by these neurons in vivo? This question of structure-function relations in brain circuits is of fundamental importance. Answering it in a quantitative manner would have far-reaching consequences both for our theories of how brain works and for applications ranging from better disease treatments to new tools for artificial intelligence. However, our current understanding of structure-function relations is relatively poor, in large part because the fine structure of neuronal connectivity has remained largely unknown. In turn, this severely limits connecting modeling to theoretical efforts. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of studying the highly heterogeneous cortical circuits, which are involved in important functions like perception, cognition, and learning.  Fortunately, recent experimental work by our collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science is now resulting in transformational new datasets that characterize connectivity in the mouse cortical area V1 at the level of Cell Types using multi-patch synaptic physiology and at the level of individual neurons using electron microscopy (EM). For the first time in history of neuroscience, we will have connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in ~1 mm3 of V1, plus systematic characterization of synaptic properties.  We will leverage these unique datasets to build and share with the community new models of V1 and use them to study the relationships between cortical connectivity and in vivo activity and computations. We will analyze how multiple features of neuronal code depend on individual cell properties and on higher-order connectivity motifs, which are present in the EM connectome, but not in the statistics-based connectivity inferred from sparse measurements at the Cell Types level or from existing literature. We also will evaluate the consistency of the new models of V1 with predictions made by current theories of structure-function relations.  These models and simulations will be freely shared with the community as a resource that scientists will use to guide future experiment designs, improve biological realism in models, and assist in generating and testing theories. By providing a rich and biologically realistic framework for new theoretical, modeling, and experimental studies, this resource will fuel new discoveries regarding relations between the structure and function of cortical circuits. To improve our understanding of the healthy brain as well as what breaks down in disease, it is essential to develop a quantitative, mechanistic description of how properties of neurons and their connections determine the properties of neural activity in vivo. This project will take advantage of unprecedented experimental datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science that contain a systematic characterization of synaptic connections between the cell types present and a connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in the mouse visual cortex. We propose to integrate these data into new, highly realistic network models of cortical circuits, use the models to explore theoretical predictions, and provide them as a resource to fuel future theoretical, modeling, and experimental work in the community.",Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue,10005712,R01EB029813,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,ALLEN INSTITUTE,R01,2020,600000,0.03552756420467853
"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9939507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334688,0.021766705870704405
"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image. We will develop an integrative strategy, which combines advanced labeling, sample preparing, imaging and computing techniques to permit automated microconnectivity analysis in regular neurobiology labs. Our study on inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex will greatly advance the fundamental knowledge about how inhibition is formed. This is highly relevant to the circuitry mechanism of Autism Spectrum Disorder and many other neural disorder diseases, which are caused by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the brain.","Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain",10025817,RF1MH123402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cre driver', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'anatomic imaging', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'learning network', 'light microscopy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,RF1,2020,2900000,0.024862919492093002
"Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability to learn new perceptual categories enables some of the most complex human behaviors, from speech perception to visual object recognition. Current understanding of the mechanisms involved in perceptual category learning relies on the fundamental assumption that the processes underlying such learning are shared across the senses. However, the vast majority of this work has focused on the visual modality. As a consequence, the research regarding how humans learn to group complex auditory information into categories has relied greatly on conclusions from the research in the visual domain without testing this critical assumption. However, recent evidence from the attention literature suggests that even seemingly domain-general cognitive processes, such as working memory, are accomplished via sensory-biased regions in frontal cortex. The current investigation will directly compare the computational and neural mechanisms supporting auditory and visual category learning by training the same individuals on categories in both modalities while in an fMRI scanner. Aim #1 of this investigation will identify the shared and sensory-biased circuits supporting feedback processing during auditory and visual category learning. If the neural circuits supporting perceptual category learning are shared across the modalities, it is expected that similar regions will be recruited to a similar extent during feedback processing. If instead, the neural circuits are distinct for particular modalities, it is expected that sensory-biased regions will emerge as supporting category learning for auditory and visual modalities. Aim #2 will utilize advanced machine learning techniques (multivariate pattern classification and representational similarity analyses) to characterize the emergence of category-level neural representations over the course of learning. Aim #3 will identify the functional and structural connectivity of the circuits as they contribute to perceptual category learning. The proposed research will directly test the fundamental assumption about the nature of this complex problem that affects everyday behaviors. This research has the potential to impact understanding of cases where modality- specific learning abilities might be impaired, such as phonetic learning and language-related impairments in dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment. The proposed research will provide the training foundation to support the PIâs long-term objective of developing theories of perceptual category learning that are constrained by neurobiology and behavior and will specify the behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of such learning. This project presents the opportunity to directly test a critical assumption underlying understanding of perceptual category learning. The proposed research will take place in an exceptional training environment and the PI will be mentored by a team of knowledgeable and accomplished scientists. The research will provide the PI with training in functional magnetic resonance experiment design and analysis which will prepare her well for a career as an independent scientist in computational cognitive neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how seemingly general-purpose cognitive systems may demonstrate modality specificity. The goal of this investigation is to characterize the differences in cognitive processing during category learning when the information comes from the auditory or visual modalities. The findings from this work may inform mechanistic approaches to understanding modality- specific deficits in language-based disorders, such as dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment.",Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning,10064815,F32DC018979,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Environment', 'Esters', 'Feedback', 'Finches', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hobbies', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'object recognition', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'theories', 'visual learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2020,64554,-0.009849815585866624
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,10016303,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'developmental prosopagnosia', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,265973,0.024643430063190617
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9897551,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,403711,0.04453849444195112
"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology Project Summary Listening in noise is a core problem in everyday hearing. Sound sources of interest routinely occur amid irrelevant distractors, as when you talk with someone in a bustling coffee shop. This background ânoiseâ distorts the pattern of spikes in the auditory nerve, often to a profound degree. Thus, to recognize sources of interest, the auditory system must somehow separate or suppress the effects of the background. Typical human hearing is remarkably noise-robust, but listeners with age-related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments â and are not much helped by contemporary hearing aids. Previous work on the neural basis of noise robustness has typically employed simple, synthetic noise sources, which lack the structure present in real-world sounds, and this work has focused on subcortical regions or on primary auditory cortex. Reasoning that real-world conditions might necessitate more complicated solutions, in the applicant's doctoral work, he considered everyday sources of noise, and leveraged the large-scale coverage afforded by fMRI to examine noise robustness throughout human auditory cortex. Real-world âbackground noiseâ was operationalized as a natural sound with statistical properties that are stable over time (i.e., are stationary), conveying little new information about the world (e.g., swamp insects, an air conditioner, rain on pavement). The applicant measured fMRI responses in human listeners to a broad set of natural sounds presented in quiet, as well as embedded in the real-world background noises. Primary auditory cortical responses were substantially altered by the background, but non-primary responses were substantially more robust. This effect was not seen for simple synthetic backgrounds as had been used in previous work, suggesting that becoming robust to real-world background noises require different mechanisms. The applicant's thesis work demonstrates where noise invariance arises, but understanding how will require data with finer spatial and temporal resolution, and thus the proposed postdoctoral research will consist of training in single-unit electrophysiology using marmosets. Aim 1A builds on previous work examining single- unit noise robustness in artificial conditions, extending such work to real-world noise. Aim 1B leverages texture models to probe what aspects of real-world backgrounds disrupt the encoding of foregrounds. Aim 2A deploys linear reconstruction techniques to probe population representations. Aim 2B involves optimizing deep neural networks for noise invariance tasks, and using them as an encoding model to predict single-unit responses. Furthermore, such networks will be deployed as nonlinear decoding algorithms, reconstructing stimuli from neuronal populations. Throughout all aims, the work will characterize neuronal responses in non-primary areas, and in particular in parabelt, which is understudied in primates. The proposed work may enable improvements in hearing aid algorithms or neural prosthetics. Lastly, this training will lay the groundwork for the applicant's long-term goal of developing a marmoset model for hearing loss. Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments â and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,10104430,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,64926,0.04818778919336997
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9944496,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing Tests', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,337875,0.08539204992303266
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,10015338,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2020,126090,0.03354808658497378
"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients. Our results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.",Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity,9870791,R01DC016915,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Problem Solving', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cortex mapping', 'electric field', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'operation', 'programs', 'semantic processing', 'sound', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,601029,0.10256329277226318
"Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior Project Summary/Abstract In order to control specific behavioral responses, transcriptionally distinct cell types assembled into dynamic brain circuits integrate environmental information with internal states and generate purposeful motor actions. While tools have been developed to independently measure the activity dynamics, connectivity and transcriptional profiles of individual neurons, it remains challenging to integrate this diverse information into a coherent model of behavior. To address this challenge, we aim to uncover the sensorimotor transformations leading to a complex naturalistic behavior, male and female parenting, by developing innovative molecular, imaging and systems-level approaches and by integrating multimodal information obtained from single neurons in behaving animals. In aim 1, we will develop new tools to uncover the activity and the transcriptional identity of neuronal cell types involved in infant-mediated behavior. In aim 2, we will explore in molecular, functional, and behavioral terms how olfactory and other sensory modalities underlie parenting behavior in males and females and in virgin versus mated states. In aim 3, we will investigate how specific hypothalamic cell types process information reflecting behavioral outcomes using a combination of spatial transcriptomic, functional imaging, circuit tracing and behavioral methods. In aim 4, we will combine cell-type based neuronal architecture with activity patterns across key brain regions to formulate predictive models underlying the neural control of parenting. Project Narrative We propose to develop a transformative multimodal experimental platform to uncover the brain-wide architecture of neuronal circuits underlying parenting behavior in molecular, functional, connectivity-based and computational terms. We will use this experimental framework to shed light into the sensory motor transformation underlying parenting behavior as a function of the animal sex and physiological state.",Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior,9971196,R01NS116593,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Child Rearing', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Discipline', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instinct', 'Investigation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'male', 'microendoscopy', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuroregulation', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'predictive modeling', 'pup', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2444289,0.02352145440288665
"Auditory brain-computer interface for communication Project Summary  A fundamental end-goal of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is to enable communication in individuals with severe motor paralysis. BCIs decode the neural signals and accomplish the intended goal via an effector, such as a computer cursor or a robotic limb. The BCI user relies on the realtime feedback of the effector's performance to modulate their neural strategy to control the external device. To date, this feedback is predominantly visual. However patients with the most severe paralysis resulting from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), some forms of stroke and traumatic brain injuries can have severe visual impairments including oculomotor fatigue, nystagmus and ophthalmoparesis - that make the reliable use of a visual-based BCI impossible. This puts a premium on developing novel solutions that can leverage sensory modalities that are intact. In this research, I will develop and test the feasibility of an auditory-based interface to establish BCI control in motor-impaired patients with severe neurological insults  In Aim 1, I propose to implement a novel paradigm using auditory cues in lieu of visual signals, and test its feasibility in controlling an effector (ie, computer cursor) to perform a cued target-acquisition task in healthy participants. This will validate the range of parameter values of the four tested auditory input signals: 1) frequency, 2) amplitude, 3) spatial azimuth and 4) spatial elevation. This approach is distinct from most binary class auditory BCI solutions, since it relies on both the natural ability of humans to localize sounds, and the ability to associate new tones to a virtual space, thus allowing a truly multi-class auditory approach. In Aim 2, I propose to implement the auditory interface into the realtime xPC used for visual presentation in clinical trial participants with intracortical BCIs, and test their performance on the cued target-acquisition task. Although much success has been demonstrated in this task using visual feedback, this auditory approach will permit BCI use by people with visual impairments further compounding their paralysis. Finally in Aim 3, I will test the feasibility of BrainGate BCI users to utilize an auditory BCI speller to perform a copy-typing task and free- typing task.  The accomplishment of the goals of this research will be a critical step towards enabling severely paralyzed individuals with visual impairments to re-establish communication independently, continuously and reliably. Project Narrative Brain-computer interfaces enable motor-impaired individuals to communicate using an effector such as a neural cursor or a robotic arm. The successful completion of the proposed project will develop a unique technology that enables a real-time auditory-reliant BCI for communication in severely paralyzed individuals resulting from stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe brain injuries. Study results will advance our knowledge of developing neurotechnologies that leverage non-visual sensory modalities, as well as provide much insight into the cortical neural activities that underpin motor intention and movement.",Auditory brain-computer interface for communication,9851289,F32MH118709,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem Infarctions', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Eye Movements', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intention', 'Joystick', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Ophthalmopareses', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Sound Localization', 'Speech', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'arm', 'auditory feedback', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'clinical trial participant', 'engineering design', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neurotechnology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'speech synthesis', 'spelling', 'success', 'usability', 'virtual', 'visual feedback', 'way finding']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,74810,0.007378735483694925
"High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids Experimental models of the human developing brain are needed to investigate human-specific aspects of brain development, evolution, and neurological disease. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of models, considering that the endogenous developing human brain cannot be directly investigated; animal models often fail to recapitulate human disorders and cannot feasibly be used to study complex polygenic states spanning many genes. While reductionist in nature, stem-cell derived 3D human brain organoids offer a first-of- its-kind opportunity to study processes of human brain formation and wiring that are otherwise not accessible. However, there is an unmet need for organoid models that are cellularly complete and reproducible and for methodology to decode the establishment, connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. If we could map the activity and connectivity of organoids at scale, both to understand circuit function/dysfunction and to guide further development of organoids, we could close the loop on organoid design and application. Towards this goal, we have developed many molecular and imaging tools for high-throughput analysis of neural activity and connectivity, which we propose to apply to new, next-generation organoid models. Here, we propose a collaborative approach among four groups (Arlotta - brain organoids and human brain development; Boyden - circuit physiology and neural imaging technology; Lewis - material science and bioengineering and Insoo Hyun- bioethics) to pioneer a robust organoid system that combines the development of vascularized brain organoids incorporating more complete cell diversity and maturation with advanced high-throughput functional molecular and imaging tools to enable interrogation of circuit activity, connectivity, and molecular changes in cells participating in physiologically relevant circuits. We will build on a highly reproducible brain organoid model that we recently developed to promote the generation of cell types that are currently absent in organoids but needed for circuit maturation, refinement, and functionality. This work is intended to generate more advanced organoid models designed to promote maturation and robust network activity. In parallel, we will develop a pipeline to record neural activity from intact organoids using all- optical-electrophysiology techniques at scale, and optimize epitope-based barcoding and expansion microscopy to enable molecularly-annotated connectomics of brain organoids. The work proposed here will enable the use of human organoid models to study human circuit formation, plasticity, and function, analyses that are currently hampered by the lack of technologies and assays for high-throughput measurements of circuit physiology and connectivity in organoids. Beyond the work proposed here, these methods will directly enable investigation into how disease states alter information processing in the brain; for example, linking mutations in disease-associated genes with specific abnormalities in human neurons and circuits to inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative  Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions worldwide and are of enormous public health significance; however, we have a very limited understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying these diseases. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of research models, given that animal models often fail to recapitulate the human disease, and that, while 3D human brain organoids offer experimental access to processes of human brain formation and wiring, methodology is needed to decode circuit function and connectivity in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity.

"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes. This work forms a basis to study central alterations following noise- induced hearing loss or other cochlear pathology, and gain deeper understanding of all auditory structures from brainstem to cortex.",The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus,9898347,R01DC015901,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biophysics', 'Birds', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'CNS processing', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear nucleus', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Octopus', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'afferent nerve', 'auditory processing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell type', 'cellular targeting', 'connectome', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'granule cell', 'health goals', 'human error', 'in silico', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular scale', 'nanoscale', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recombinase', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory system', 'sound', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R01,2020,620597,0.0429033057081429
