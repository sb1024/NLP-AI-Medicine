"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring. Results could offer substantial improvements in prognosis of glaucoma and may provide surrogate endpoints for use in glaucoma clinical trials.",A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring,9723609,R21EY030142,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Gaussian model', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data space', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'field study', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'retinal ganglion cell degeneration', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2019,278421,0.05258474507566032
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9643493,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,545657,0.016998874805735066
"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,-0.0003773940053546475
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9688867,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,416786,0.050266842162936066
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9613247,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2019,165108,0.014158128664812614
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,9819321,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,715489,0.025005771726544616
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9697824,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,564228,0.05800965853388128
"Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Advances in health care have been dramatic since the beginning of the millennium. As a result, people are living longer with age-related diseases, and the number of older individuals unable to live independently is rising rapidly. Mobile computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor behavior and use the large amount of collected data to automate analysis of functional health in a person's everyday settings. This project focuses on evaluating the performance and commercial viability of technologies that will meet some of the needs that this coming age wave introduces by automating assessment of a person's functional performance. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health using behavior patterns as sensed by a smart watch. Achieving this objective will provide a foundation for the Phase II application goal of using multiple information sources to automatically-generate activity scores and functional health measures from sensor data. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach creates a profile of a person's routine behavior through automated real-time recognition of complex activities from mobile sensor data (Aim 1). We will evaluate the use of machine learning techniques to map behavior features onto cognitive and mobility health scores provided through app and in-person neuropsychological assessment (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate an interactive visual tool for displaying behavior patterns to provide individuals and their caregivers with insights on their routines and relationship with their health status (Aim 3). This work has important health care implications as functional impairment has been associated with negative outcomes including increased health care utilization, falls, and conversion to dementia. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, it is imperative to commercialize technologies that increase functional independence while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to evaluate the performance and commercial viability of an application that can predict an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health based on patterns that are sensed by a smart watch, and effectively and efficiently present this information to the caregiver. This work will lay the foundation for a commercial tool to analyze behavior routines and automate assessment of functional health. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden, and improve quality of life.",Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities,9842127,R41EB029774,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Commercial Sectors', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'care costs', 'commercialization', 'commercially viable technology', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'family support', 'functional disability', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized care', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,"ADAPTELLIGENCE, LLC",R41,2019,347739,-0.01884826464088536
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. The project leverages a 100-patient population in our 11 partner facilities (assisted living and skill nursing), recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,-0.032042035281990566
"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome There is an essential gap in understanding the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior of adults with Down syndrome (DS): objective assessment of these behaviors with accelerometers has not been developed for this population. If this gap remains unfilled, it may impede efforts to objectively quantify the problem of inactivity in adults with DS and to develop effective interventions for improving physical activity and reducing health disparities in this population. Objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior for adults with DS will advance by considering their pathologically low aerobic fitness. It may also improve by applying to accelerometer output innovative machine-learning modes. The long-term goals of the present applicants are to understand the determinants of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS and develop effective interventions for improving their physical activity and health. The objective of this application, in pursuit of the long-term goals, is to calibrate accelerometer output for measuring physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with DS. The central hypothesis is that machine learning applied to accelerometer output will permit accurate prediction of physical activity type and intensity in adults with DS. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data and previous work that has successfully developed machine learning models for individuals without disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that accurate measurement of physical activity and sedentariness will lead to better monitoring of these behaviors in adults with DS and to more precise quantification of the effects of interventions for improving their health. Guided by the applicants’ preliminary data and previous work, and a critical review of the empirical knowledge-base, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) compare the relationship between accelerometer output and energy expenditure across various physical activities and sedentary behaviors between adults with and without DS; and (2) develop machine learning models from accelerometer output and evaluate their accuracy for predicting physical activity type and energy expenditure in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 1, output from hip- and wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers and energy expenditure expressed relative to aerobic fitness will be measured during physical activities and sedentary behaviors in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 2, machine learning models for predicting physical activity type and intensity will be developed in samples of adults with and without DS, and their prediction accuracy will be tested in two additional samples. The approach is innovative, because: (a) it will calibrate accelerometer output while accounting for aerobic fitness; (b) it will refine calibration by utilizing machine learning models. The proposed research is significant because it will allow researchers and public health agencies to more precisely monitor the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS. Such knowledge is critical for the development of interventions for improving physical activity, health, and quality of life in adults with DS. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing valid objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with Down syndrome is an essential step towards designing effective interventions for improving physical activity, fitness, health, and quality of life in these persons. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NICHD’s mission that pertains to ensuring the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.",Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome,9730779,R15HD098660,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Calibration', 'Data', 'Down Syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinesiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'graduate student', 'hands-on learning', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'national surveillance', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'therapy development', 'undergraduate student']",NICHD,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,423824,0.023586733597420678
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",9976771,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,299863,-0.01133663475911905
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users. This project supports the NIH's stated mission of reducing disability by improving patient outcomes with new prosthetic and orthotic devices.",Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time,9668174,R03HD092639,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prosthesis', 'Reference Values', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'light weight', 'neural network', 'novel', 'respiratory gas', 'robotic device', 'sensor', 'wearable device']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2019,78000,0.016791681078565514
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9796542,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Comorbidity', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,488645,0.006050430184586387
"Remote vital sign and opioid overdose detection via a non-invasive wearable sensing patch PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Approximately 2 million Americans are living with an opioid use disorder, and in 2017, 17,029 people overdosed on prescription opioids. Opioids cause respiratory depression; however, fatal overdose usually occurs over a period of 1–3 hours, leaving a window of opportunity to intervene with the inexpensive drug naloxone, an opioid antagonist, that can reverse the effects of opioids, quickly restoring normal respiration rates. VivaLNK proposes to enhance the currently marketed Vital Scout wellness wearable sensing patch for use in people at risk for opioid overdose, by detecting physiologic indicators of an opioid overdose (slow respiration rate, low heart rate and low blood pressure), and the ability to send a potentially life-saving overdose alert, which could be received by an emergency contact/caregiver and hasten treatment with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Health monitoring emergency notification systems that can remotely monitor patient vital signs for indications of deterioration and send a potentially life-saving alert to emergency contacts/caregivers, have the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatal opioid overdoses in the US. The Vital Scout patch is already strategically positioned to monitor overdose parameters utilizing the built in ECG sensor to continuously register waveforms from which respiration rate, heart rate, heart rate variability, and activity are calculated. While several devices are currently being developed for overdose alerts, the Vital Scout is the only alert which has the potential to capture the three critical vital signs indicative of an overdose, and simultaneously monitor physical activity, providing additional context to the vital signs data. The vital signs collected by the Vital Scout patch are based on a machine-learning algorithm which we propose to further develop by the following specific aims: 1) Refinement and optimization of the Vital Scout to incorporate an overdose algorithm with an alert function by improving the sensitivity in order to detect lower respiration and heart rate indicative of a potential overdose. 2) Expand the sensing capabilities of the Vital Scout system to include blood pressure monitoring. The algorithm will be optimized using three volunteer cohorts (~20/ cohort) (i) healthy volunteers, (ii) elderly patients over the age of 65 (more likely to have low BP due to medically-induced hypotension) and (iii) low BP patients (represented by elite student-athletes). Data from these cohorts will provide the initial broad range of data for the machine-learning linear regression algorithm. We will assess whether these are appropriate designations for providing accurate blood pressure measurements, similar to what is seen within the opioid population. Meeting all of these goals will result in an enhanced Vital Scout that will be the most sensitive device for opioid overdose detection to remotely monitor the vital signs of people addicted to opioids and those at-risk for opioid overdose, including but not limited to, people with pulmonary disease or those taking antidepressants. PROJECT NARRATIVE The US is experiencing an opioid epidemic, with approximately 2 million Americans living with an opioid use disorder, and in 2017, 17,029 people overdosed on prescription opioids.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9768419,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,606526,0.01087473648607999
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9720954,R01MH111610,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Psychologist', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Translating', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'health application', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microphone', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment response', 'wearable device', 'wireless fidelity']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,800196,0.02071975912641776
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",9661385,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,200000,0.009982591406584588
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,0.023776210427575422
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9658873,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,317858,0.026943526532378446
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,9818246,R01DK122473,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Elderly', 'Energy Intake', 'Feedback', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthy Eating', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastication', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'healthy weight', 'increased appetite', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'sucking', 'synergism', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'weight maintenance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2019,663683,0.03608846723724431
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9755242,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'convolutional neural network', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,193160,0.04605290033942623
"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9778822,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,660041,-0.01107922392928473
"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9765006,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,551932,-0.007298376587880427
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults.

"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,9821055,K23HD096134,"['Address', 'Biomechanics', 'Caregiver support', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coin', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personnel Management', 'Physical activity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Secondary to', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'muscle strength', 'neurological recovery', 'opportunity cost', 'patient mobility', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sensor', 'translational study', 'wearable device']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,136420,0.005969129512822036
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9735326,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396887,0.011122393756734043
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9701986,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2019,362004,0.058798377980550307
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9671858,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2019,613264,0.05692585604288994
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,0.044971089614522286
"Personalizing Glaucoma Diagnosis by Disease Specific Patterns and Individual Eye Anatomy Project Summary/Abstract Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve which is accompanied by visual ﬁeld (VF) loss. While accurate VF loss diagnosis and the detection of its progression over time is of high relevance to clinical practitioners as it indicates the initiation of or change in ocular therapy, there is no consensus on objective measures for this purpose, and VF measurements are known to be often unreliable. The main objective of this project is to develop clinically applicable measures to improve the diagnosis of glaucomatous VF loss and of its progression by two approaches: First, the identiﬁcation of representative loss patterns and their progression, achieved by large-scale, customized bioinformatical procedures applied to data from glaucoma patients from nine clinical centers and second, the inclusion of eye and patient speciﬁc personalized parameters. In total, 480,486 VFs, are available for this project. One major aim is to develop novel diagnostic indices based on computationally identiﬁed evolution patterns of VF loss, particularly (1) an index that denotes the probability of glaucomatous vision loss and (2) an index that assigns probabilities to a VF that follow-up measurements will be in a certain defect class. The indices will be statistically evaluated on separate VF samples and compared to existing approaches. Routinely available patient speciﬁc parameters which are candidates to impact glaucomatous vision loss are patient ethnicity, type of glaucoma, spherical equivalent (SE) of refractive error and the location of the blind spot relative to ﬁxation. The effect of these parameters on the vision loss patterns will be systematically studied. The impact of their inclusion in the novel diagnostic indices and their potential improvement on glaucoma diagnosis will be quantiﬁed on a separate data set. A further aim is the calculation of a spatial map speciﬁc to a measured VF that represents the preferred VF locations of future defects as well as their reliability as an aid to event-based progression diagnosis. A second major objective is the investigation of the relationship of VF loss and individual parameters related to retinal structure, based on retinal nerve ﬁber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements around the optic disc. The inter-relationship of representative patterns of RNFLT and its decrease over time with trajectories of major retinal arteries, SE, and blind spot location is systematically studied, and the impact on patterns of VF loss is quantitatively analyzed with the goal to improve the interpretation of existing VF loss and to predict future glaucomatous vision loss. Main contributions of the project with relevance to clinical practice are publicly available open-source software implementations of new diagnostic indices and maps, enhanced by individual functional and structural parameters, and a detailed and personalized model for the relationship between retinal structure and glaucomatous vision loss. Project Narrative Glaucoma is an ocular disease accompanied by vision loss which may progress over time up to total blindness, but the assessment of glaucomatous vision loss is noisy, and it is often hard for clinical practitioners to decide whether changes over time reﬂect true changes of functional vision or are the result of normal measurement variations or artifacts. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the impact of individual anatomical parameters on the spatial patterns of glaucomatous vision loss in order to improve the diagnosis of vision loss and of its progression.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community.

"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9693725,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,515083,0.02174805114446938
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9780348,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2019,41136,0.04048482560500981
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9735228,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,397016,0.015899087822387227
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9772539,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,189743,0.023739551199391598
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes. n/a",Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry,9903672,R01GM135927,"['Accelerometer', 'Activity Cycles', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Big Data', 'Body Temperature', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Dust', 'Encapsulated', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'circadian', 'design', 'diaries', 'health related quality of life', 'heart rate monitor', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'metastatic colorectal', 'multimodality', 'personalized intervention', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,316425,0.026343832285832154
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways. Our goals are to: identify candidate gene(s) that modulate optic nerve damage; determine if regulation of intraocular pressure and/or optic nerve damage are shared across species; and identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models. These outcomes will fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development.",Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma,9648959,R01EY021200,"['Age', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Death', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Inbreeding', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'age related', 'cell injury', 'cellular targeting', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'gene product', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'human data', 'human model', 'lead candidate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preservation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment strategy']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2019,391271,0.01579955413807041
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,0.011574686247465852
"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings. Currently, exoskeletons are not approved for independent-use because functionalities like transferring from standing-to-sitting requires continuous assistance from caregivers.",Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety,9560683,R44AG057267,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bionics', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fall injury', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Letters', 'Mechanics', 'Metric System', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'blind', 'combat', 'community setting', 'critical period', 'deconditioning', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'human study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation technology', 'robot exoskeleton', 'stroke patient']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,806285,-0.013639531719542504
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9832864,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,669616,0.015263399489985606
"Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness Abstract Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage (OH) before onset of shock is a universally acknowledged great unmet need, and particularly important after trauma. Delays in the detection of OH are associated with a “failure to rescue” and a dramatic deterioration in prognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. While uniplex noninvasive technologies have failed to detect or diagnose complex disease states, we have demonstrated the superiority of multiplex approaches in silico. The goal of this STTR project is to develop a commercially viable optoimpedance sensor-based system that combines state-of-the-art noninvasive sensing technologies and advanced multivariable statistical algorithms. Phase I will involve three Aims: 1) D​esign, Fabricate and Test Opto-Impedance oPiic sensors, 2) Develop of Mobile App, Data and ML Pipeline on Secure Cloud, and 3) Evaluate oPiics on an Unanesthetized Upright Porcine Hemorrhage Model. By derisking the hardware challenges, we will be well-positioned for a Phase II application to optimize oPiic design and manufacturing, fold-in predictive algorithms under current development with DOD support, and validate with a clinical trial in critical care setting. Project Narrative We have demonstrated that a multiplex approach is superior to predicting shock compared to single clinical devices alone. During a mass-casualty event, a predictive tool would need to be deployed widely, since only a fraction of individuals will have ongoing hemorrhage that will progress to decompensated shock. Optical and bioimpedance signals are critical indicators of muscle hemodynamics and electrolyte balance likely to be modified in the period leading up to shock. No commercial device exists that provides continuous, low-power, low-cost monitoring of these signals with characteristics suitable for integration with the multiplexing approach. This STTR application seeks Phase I funding to commercialize an opto-impedance sensor, called the ‘oPiic’, that will address this unmet need.",Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness,9909081,R41EB029284,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber Optics', 'Funding', 'General anesthetic drugs', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolism', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electric impedance', 'electrical property', 'hemodynamics', 'instrument', 'light weight', 'mass casualty', 'member', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'optical sensor', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'response to injury', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tissue oxygenation', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,"MULTIVARIATE SYSTEMS, INC.",R41,2019,155282,0.010556559585842583
"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9464374,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,470142,0.050266842162936066
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9564111,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,564228,0.05800965853388128
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9453227,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2018,166481,0.014158128664812614
"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calories', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietitian', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Malnutrition', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Wearable Computer', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'digital models', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'healthy lifestyle', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle factors', 'mathematical model', 'negative affect', 'programs', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,0.050215382992318223
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants Ensuring access to clean water for generations to come will involve developing novel ap- proaches to determining the safety and composition of potable water that are practical and afford- able. Arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are three of the top priorities among hazardous substances commonly found at Superfund sites, as they are linked to health problems in people exposed to them in drinking water, yet the current real-time monitoring methods for these and other contam- inants are either extremely costly or nonexistent, making it difﬁcult to monitor water quality with high spatial or temporal resolution. QBiSci is developing a biosensor that uses synthetic micro- bial sensor strains that ﬂuoresce in response to speciﬁc toxins to continuously monitor water for contamination. The platform will substantially improve upon currently available technologies for toxin detection, making monitoring more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable. Speciﬁc Aim 1: To fully characterize three synthetic E. coli strains that speciﬁcally detect ar- senic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water stream. For a real-time sensor to be maxi- mally effective, it must be able to report accurate toxin concentrations in real-time. Focusing on three of the highest priority contaminants as a proof of feasibility, comprehensive data will be acquired to train a machine learning algorithm to be able classify real-world samples in real-time. Speciﬁc Aim 2: To develop and train a classiﬁcation algorithm to recognize the type and amount of each contaminant present in a continuous water stream. The ability to analyze and interpret data in real-time from a constantly ﬂuctuating water source will require an extensive classiﬁcation train- ing effort. QBiSci's existing machine learning framework will be trained and tested using many contamination induction scenarios, ranging from sudden pulses to subtly varying concentrations. Speciﬁc Aim 3: To develop a microﬂuidic cartridge system that reduces device complexity and enables sensor deployment with minimal intervention. QBiSci will develop a swappable car- tridge system using devices that are pre-loaded with biologically-stable strains and can simply be “plugged in” to the sensor platform to achieve repeatable results in a user-friendly manner. The development of a method for thermoplastic device fabrication will enable the more precise connections required for a cartridge clamping system that will require little operational expertise.  A successful outcome of this proposal will lead to a biosensor capable of real-time quantiﬁca- tion of arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water input. A future Phase II proposal would focus on real-world performance evaluations of our sensors via deployment in areas of con- cern and comparison of our results to standard techniques as well as an expansion of the platform to detect other contaminants quantitatively and continuously. 1 Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country over 100,000 hazardous waste sites are so heavily contaminated that the un- derlying groundwater doesn't meet drinking water standards. While there is a wide range of toxins found at these sites, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are among the most common offend- ers, all of which have been linked to a variety of health problems ranging from cancer to dia- betes as well as behavior and neurological disorders. We are developing a customizable real-time biosensor that will enable contamination monitoring to become more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable and will facilitate improved management decisions aimed at reducing toxin con- centrations in the environment, tracking the progression of contamination plums, and targeting investments in remediation efforts. 1",A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants,9467134,R43ES028993,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arsenic', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Cadmium', 'Classification', 'Closure by clamp', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hazardous Substances', 'Hazardous Waste Sites', 'Health', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plug-in', 'Plum', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'contaminated water', 'cost', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'real time monitoring', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'superfund site', 'temporal measurement', 'user-friendly', 'water quality']",NIEHS,"QUANTITATIVE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,162205,0.01633082246520704
"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9576355,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,672594,0.01087473648607999

"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9524533,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,712358,-0.01107922392928473
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults. Results will be used to build more predictive health behavior theories and inform personalized behavior interventions to reduce obesity and improve public health.",Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance,9576883,U01HL146327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Voice', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'demographics', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'emerging adulthood', 'ethnic diversity', 'improved', 'lifetime risk', 'mobile computing', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'trend', 'weight gain prevention']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2018,594652,0.02984924991322922
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9682871,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,40644,0.04048482560500981
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9427452,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,400000,0.011122393756734043
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9566306,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,30000,-0.03223564864339916
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9470866,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2018,345436,0.058798377980550307
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9601212,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,195600,0.044971089614522286
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9442751,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2018,673206,0.05692585604288994

"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9461051,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,435074,0.02174805114446938
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community.

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9542295,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'social', 'social model', 'societal costs', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'visiting scholar', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,955747,0.0015080853150323823
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9547265,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,395830,0.015899087822387227
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9502787,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mobility enhancement', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,227166,0.023739551199391598
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user.

"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9272400,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2017,188594,-0.001980521773414289
"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development of a clinically useful novel, empirical system for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and on the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma,9298423,R21EY027945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'expectation', 'glaucoma test', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2017,232500,0.023563085465626576
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9290961,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,441204,0.050266842162936066
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9346616,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,172086,0.061571719794937536
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9390382,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'capillary', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,559269,0.05800965853388128
"Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the  top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent  hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the  activities of daily living. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase  quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a  fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices  require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of  showing caregivers how falls occur.  Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense (also known as SafelyYou), an online fall detection  system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and  related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL will confirm the fall  detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms. We will demonstrate it for 100  patients in 13 memory care facilities. Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for  specific patients; for ex., some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should  be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night. It does not require action of individuals  / caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well-suited for individuals with ADRD.  We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence)  approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will  call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The human can monitor  several facilities at a given time.  This project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 13 memory care facilities,  recruited through our previous (IRB approved) pilot. The work will leverage our previous three  pilots. • Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. • Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility from  the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to  clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from 13 and 11 in the first 2 months to 2 in the  final month, due to video review with care staff. • Pilot 3 (ongoing): We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in  13 facilities of the Carlton, Integral Senior Living, Pacifica and SRG networks, totaling 100  patients already monitored by our system (offline). The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the 100 cameras in these facilities into a  real-time fall detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL support.  Compared to a 3-month baseline from the 100 cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with 150+  participants [8,14]. The proposed NestSense system uses off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to perform detection of  safety-critical events for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia patients in memory care  facilities. It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers (e.g., through wearing  any kind of device). The NestSense technology provides the first robust non-wearable fall detection  tuned specifically to the privacy-security tradeoffs of dementia care. It provides an answer to  today’s technology gaps (far from 100% reliability) by use of a Human-in-the Loop (HIL) paradigm to  enable a quick rollout of the technology. Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of  our system by patients, family, and memory care staff in the Carlton, Integral Senior Living,  Pacifica and SRG networks, we have deployed the system in offline mode in 13 facilities of the  network, monitoring 100 patients. The research, implementation, and deployment work encompassed in  this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof  of concept, operational in real-time mode, with HIL, to reduce fall-related hospitalizations and  time spent on the ground. The pilot follows 3 previous pilots, the most recent of which deploys  cameras with these 100 patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of  occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care. This study will translate those cameras  into a real-time fall (online) detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL  support. Compared to a 3-month baseline from the cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on previous clinical trials with 100+ participants [8,14].",Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias,9465622,R43AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Event', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Managed Care', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scheduling and Staffing', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'falls', 'human-in-the-loop', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'success', 'time use', 'willingness']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R43,2017,150000,-0.0006687434566961379
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones.

"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention.

"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9357585,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,300665,0.030943603317872107
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9210068,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2017,152937,0.05232649101121129
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9340389,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2017,30000,-0.03223564864339916
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor.

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9308944,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2017,339155,0.058798377980550307
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9284636,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2017,566219,0.05692585604288994
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,0.01930446821334528
"Active Power Exoskeleton Device for Spinal Cord Injury ! ABSTRACT Significance: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) cause costly and morbid chronic conditions such as lack of voluntary movement, increased chance of pressure sores, problematic spasticity, loss of bowel, bladder, and sexual function, and more physical impairments which result in a lower quality of life and lack of independence. Approximately 285,000 people in the U.S. have SCI with ~17,000 new patients added each year. Current treatment options include an array of electrical stimulation interventions or high-intensity fitness regimens, but all share one common limitation of being episodic in their treatment delivery. There is a compelling need for a treatment option that can be used daily, improves Activities of Daily Living (ADL’s), allows for in- home rehab and most importantly provides patient independence. Enabling technology exists, often proven in other medical device applications, that can facilitate the design of an upper limb orthotic system to deliver the functional performance required by SCI patients. The OlympEX Medical Actively Powered Exoskeleton (APEX) device can meet the functional movement requirements, will be designed for in-home use and be affordable to the user. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the APEX orthotic system will achieve clinically meaningful improvement in a SCI patient’s range of motion (ROM) capability to perform ADL’s and to perform upper limb rehab in an in-home setting. Preliminary Work: The APEX orthotic system will be the third generation of orthotic device system to be developed by OlympEX Medical. Generations 1 and 2 are passively powered device systems that have provided the OlympEX design engineering team experience with mechanical apparatus requirements to elevate an upper limb. Likewise, the team has developed capabilities in advanced materials for the body chassis for these devices. The APEX orthotic system evolves from these product platforms to introduce system features in device guidance and user control only obtainable with an actively powered system. Specific Aims: This project entails the APEX hardware/electronic architecture development and the acute pre-clinical evaluation of the system on N=3 patients to evaluate patient safety and device feasibility. In Specific Aim 1 we will design, fabricate and evaluate the APEX mechanical design with electronic architecture. A subset of the APEX functional arm movements will be developed to demonstrate feasibility in performing a limited number of high priority ADL’s. In Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate the performance of this subset of ADL’s on 3 SCI patients. Success criteria will be Pass/Fail as evaluated by clinicians. In addition, an initial patient safety assessment will be completed. Safety factors including discomfort or pain before and after the fitting of the device and no uncontrolled arm movements will be evaluated. Together, these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of APEX device to guide arm movements required to complete ADL’s and therapeutic arm movements in an ambulatory setting. ! Project Narrative Those with cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) have reduced ability to voluntarily move and use their arms and hands which results in the inability to accomplish many activities of daily living. OlympEX Medical proposes to develop and test an active powered upper extremity exoskeleton to help people with SCI and other neuromuscular conditions with their upper-limb function and rehabilitation. This will improve health, rehabilitative technology, quality of life, and independence for those with SCI.",Active Power Exoskeleton Device for Spinal Cord Injury,9465618,R43HD094440,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Bladder', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Eating', 'Elbow', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Safety', 'Sex Functioning', 'Shoulder', 'Source', 'Spastic', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Therapeutic', 'Upper Extremity', 'Voice', 'Weight Gain', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'light weight', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'operation', 'orthotics', 'patient safety', 'phase 2 study', 'phrases', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'spasticity', 'success', 'volunteer']",NICHD,"ABILITECH MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2017,239802,-0.01559340325892361
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9288252,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child health care', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,450361,0.02174805114446938
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9333122,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,401742,0.0015080853150323823
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9368213,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,397661,0.015899087822387227
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings. Currently, exoskeletons are not approved for independent-use because functionalities like transferring from standing-to-sitting requires continuous assistance from caregivers.",Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety,9409715,R44AG057267,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bionics', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fall injury', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Letters', 'Mechanics', 'Metric System', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'blind', 'combat', 'community setting', 'critical period', 'deconditioning', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'human study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation technology', 'robot exoskeleton']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2017,653843,-0.013639531719542504
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9109063,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,580914,0.016172472436000417
"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.        ",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9112492,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2016,225750,-0.001980521773414289
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9030093,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,542228,0.050266842162936066
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9180261,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,221705,0.061571719794937536
"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,-0.012617253950380922
"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.        ",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9078547,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning network', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,299438,0.030943603317872107
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports.

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",9148070,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2016,47190,0.01226115445382629
"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization. The team members with clinical expertise have been engaged in blood pressure trials in US, and have been working with leading institutions in India engaged in cardiovascular research. This proposal brings together their unique expertise and experience to innovatively address this challenging problem through a joint effort.

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9157753,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary activity', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2016,400434,0.058798377980550307
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9133378,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall injury', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,166809,0.01930446821334528
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9105328,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'mobile computing', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2016,456419,-0.0054456966731559215
"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8989994,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2016,230028,0.033416281490388375
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9103879,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,401742,0.0015080853150323823

The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9131810,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2016,187000,0.05141912034335486
"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.",Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging,9084580,K23EY022659,"['Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal Blindness', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Master of Science', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'advanced disease', 'biomathematics', 'central visual field', 'clinical investigation', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'next generation', 'programs', 'retina outer nuclear layer', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,229139,0.04090451167177383
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8892259,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,613425,0.016172472436000417
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8892263,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,413392,-0.012617253950380922

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8891470,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor impairment', 'named group', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2015,223669,0.043534565885229665
"In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new system called GaitRF that can measure walking speed and other detailed gait parameters passively within the home. The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as those suffering from neurologic or physical ailments. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. Gait is typically measured periodically within a clinical setting. In-home monitoring offers the advantage of continuous and ongoing measurements providing significantly more information about changes in a patient's health under real life conditions. Ongoing accurate estimation of gait within the home can help to guide caregivers about the need for transitioning older adults to higher levels of care. Accurate in-home gait monitoring also has the potential to encourage older adults to maintain independence later into their lives by enabling family members and friends to monitor health status remotely.  The proposed system makes use of novel wireless technology being developed at EmbedRF. An array of tiny transceivers are positioned in either a hallway or doorframe and configured to wirelessly send radio frequency (RF) signals between each other. As a person walks past the transceivers, their body disrupts the RF signal strength allowing for the estimation of gait metric without the need for the person to wear any monitoring device. Preliminary results using only 2 or 4 transceivers have already demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate walking speed. Preliminary results also show the unique ability to discriminate between individuals for use in a multi-resident home or to exclude data when a caregiver or friend visits. Specific aims in this proposal will 1) further develop prototype systems for walking speed estimation using transceiver pairs, 2) research and develop use of an array of sensors placed at base-board height in order to extract more detailed gait metrics; a second transceiver pair will be placed at approximate head height to provide multi-person discrimination capability, and 3) perform preliminary in-home evaluations of the GaitRF system. Advanced machine learning and tracking algorithms will be utilized to process the RF signals to extract gait metrics. We will evaluate the performance of GaitRF in both a laboratory setting and within single-resident and multi- resident homes of seniors.  If successful, this new system has the advantage of being low-cost, unobtrusive, and easy to install, while still providing accurate and detailed gait metrics. The system can be used as a stand-alone gait monitor or incorporated into more general health monitoring systems. Application of the technology will support independent living and may also be used in clinical trials of drugs or procedures that affect mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as individuals suffering from cognitive or physical impairment. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. We propose to develop a low cost system called GaitRF that can passively and unobtrusively measure detailed gait metrics in the home to support monitoring of seniors living independently or at an assisted living facility.            ",In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers,8904402,R43AG049573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Friends', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Width', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'particle', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'signal processing']",NIA,"EMBEDRF, LLC",R43,2015,225000,-0.029549350567737075
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed. The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.",Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit,8840546,R01CA164993,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Cancer Control', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Housekeeping', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marshal', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'computerized data processing', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'novel', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,536065,0.04797309914851257
"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",8980210,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2015,56042,0.01226115445382629
"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition,8792219,R01EY022039,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,379750,0.022489655890785172
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9077885,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2015,846167,-0.0054456966731559215
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,164698,0.01930446821334528
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility.

Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). If successful, the new monitoring device object of this proposal named ""Joint Health Monitor"" will have an immediate impact on managing joint degradation, reducing complicated revision surgeries and allowing more effective patient surveillance avoiding catastrophic failure; this in turn will increase patient confidence in regulatory agencies and industry.            ",Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics,8906609,R43AR067048,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arithmetic', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Bone Tissue', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumer Advocacy', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Dislocations', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hip region structure', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteolysis', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Radiation', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trust', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'follow-up', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'human subject', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'rapid detection', 'sample fixation', 'tool']",NIAMS,"BRUIN BIOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2015,149685,-0.009219237163691978
"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8798661,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2015,228148,0.033416281490388375
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.            ",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,8949658,K24NR015812,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'patient oriented research', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2015,188616,0.05141912034335486
"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.",Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging,8866409,K23EY022659,"['Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal Blindness', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Master of Science', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'advanced disease', 'biomathematics', 'central visual field', 'clinical investigation', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'next generation', 'programs', 'retina outer nuclear layer', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,229139,0.04090451167177383
"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.                ",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8749880,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'named group', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2014,204427,0.043534565885229665
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures. These generic tools for daily care and research can be deployed across diseases and disabilities.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180608,0.01930446821334528
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track  ABSTRACT The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic affect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs to unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the elderly can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.            ",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,8647170,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2014,222981,-0.006247382104505376
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8775015,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,209258,0.0015080853150323823
"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8786916,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2014,248999,0.033416281490388375
"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.          Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.

"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8665495,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mobile application', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2014,330324,0.013535694129693876
"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING  PROJECT ABSTRACT Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.            ",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8620889,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198360,0.05070591561314357
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.                   ",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8496352,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,636036,0.016172472436000417
"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children. We will develop models to assess physical activity and to predict energy expenditure in preschoolers using advanced technology (room calorimetry, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, miniaturized heart rate monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity and energy expenditure in preschool-aged children.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,-0.012617253950380922
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions.

"Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S.; worldwide it results in >5,000,000 premature deaths each year. The majority of smokers express a desire to quit, and each year more than half will. However, less than 7% of those who quit will achieve long-term abstinence. Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of the first cigarette following a quit attempt (i.e. lapse), which include situations (e.g. presence of other smokers) and activities (e.g. alcohol consumption). While ideally this information could be used to develop a system that detects these predictive antecedents in real-time and provides just-in-time intervention; to date no such systems have been developed. The overarching goal of our research program is to develop and test such a system that uses smartphone technology. The system developed here can be incorporated into diverse application platforms that target the modification of smoking and multiple other health related behaviors including drug and alcohol use, food consumption and physical activity. Despite the fact that smoking is a known cause of death and disability, many smokers find it very difficult to quit and those who do quit often return to smoking (i.e. lapse). Although the situational factors leading up to a lapse are well documented, treatments designed to interrupt these situations before relapse occurs have not been forthcoming. Here, we propose to develop a smartphone-based system that can detect these situations in real-time. Once developed, the sensor system can be incorporated into mobile smoking cessation applications designed to help smokers avoid relapse.",Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior,8494033,R21DA034471,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Paper', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Salivary', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Motion', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'drinking', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'food consumption', 'innovation', 'premature', 'programs', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'sound', 'technology development', 'technology/technique', 'therapy design', 'virtual', 'visual imagery']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,188400,-0.018043238688813766
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.          Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.

"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8521678,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2013,343684,0.013535694129693876
"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children. We will develop models to assess physical activity and to predict energy expenditure in preschoolers using advanced technology (room calorimetry, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, miniaturized heart rate monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity and energy expenditure in preschool-aged children.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.                  The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise.

"Passive Activity Monitoring with Patient Identification and Gesture Detection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). Ingenium Care proposes to create a passive, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons using the novel technology of Microsoft's Kinect device. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium Care's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, people with disabilities, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. Existing monitoring technology has limited activity recognition capability or uses many sensors and wearable devices. The need for wearable devices requires cooperation from the elderly that may not reminder or resent to wear it. We propose to replace our existing wearable badge technology with a passive device based on the Kinect device from Microsoft. A network of these sensors provides precise location information within a home or facility and detects falls and gestures such as eating, drinking or taking medications. This device will eliminate the need to wear any device. Aim #1 - Goal: Develop Algorithms for Proof of Concept Gesture Recognition. Aim #2 - Goal: Do laboratory training and testing of detection algorithms utilizing a single work station. Aim #3 - Goal: Perform randomized activities and gestures in a simulated living environment and iteratively improve algorithms.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S.; worldwide it results in >5,000,000 premature deaths each year. The majority of smokers express a desire to quit, and each year more than half will. However, less than 7% of those who quit will achieve long-term abstinence. Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of the first cigarette following a quit attempt (i.e. lapse), which include situations (e.g. presence of other smokers) and activities (e.g. alcohol consumption). While ideally this information could be used to develop a system that detects these predictive antecedents in real-time and provides just-in-time intervention; to date no such systems have been developed. The overarching goal of our research program is to develop and test such a system that uses smartphone technology. The system developed here can be incorporated into diverse application platforms that target the modification of smoking and multiple other health related behaviors including drug and alcohol use, food consumption and physical activity. Despite the fact that smoking is a known cause of death and disability, many smokers find it very difficult to quit and those who do quit often return to smoking (i.e. lapse). Although the situational factors leading up to a lapse are well documented, treatments designed to interrupt these situations before relapse occurs have not been forthcoming. Here, we propose to develop a smartphone-based system that can detect these situations in real-time. Once developed, the sensor system can be incorporated into mobile smoking cessation applications designed to help smokers avoid relapse.",Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior,8402249,R21DA034471,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Paper', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Salivary', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Motion', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'drinking', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'food consumption', 'innovation', 'premature', 'programs', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'sound', 'technology development', 'technology/technique', 'therapy design', 'virtual', 'visual imagery']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,196250,-0.018043238688813766
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma  ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.              Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of smoking behavior.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

"Interactive, Self-programming, AI System for Activity Monitoring of the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). More than half felt they were ""on duty"" 24 hours a day, and half had to end/reduce employment due to the demands of care-giving. Ingenium proposes to create a practical, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly, disabled, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. The goal in this proposal is to produce a system that can reliably recognize activities using only one Ingenium wireless room-master per room and an Ingenium wearable wireless badge linked to an AI system with self-learning capability. This is accomplished through the interactive badge and room masters. In contrast, existing technology uses many sensors and requires off-line processing to train the activity recognizer and is not useable beyond laboratory environments. Additionally, no current commercial system has interactive planning and scheduling support. Ingenium will utilize the assistance of the AI lab staff at Washington State University which is an acknowledged leader in recognizing activities of daily living. Aim #1 will re-create the WSU technology, transfer activity knowledge to the Ingenium platform and enhance the platform with interactive self learning Aim #2 will outfit the WSU smart apartment with the Ingenium system. The smart apartment has a complex set of 37 sensors. The Ingenium system will both simplify and enhance the WSU configuration by utilizing only 7 Ingenium room-masters. Twenty students will participate in a study to verify that the Ingenium system provides superior activity location and recognition than the current wired multiple motion sensor system. Aim #3 will test the ability of the enhanced interactive prompting and learning capability of the Ingenium system to learn the same activities without the knowledge transfer hence validating a real time learning activity recognizer is possible in a commercializable system. One of goals of Ingenium's business plan is to commercialize this system. .      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Computational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, and progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway.

"Longitudinal validity of accelerometry in youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the inception of parent grant (July 2007), pattern recognition approaches such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, and hidden Markov models have emerged as a viable and potentially more accurate alternative to traditional regression based cut-point methods. Whereas cut-point methods have proven to be modestly useful for broadly classifying the absolute intensity of physical activity, preliminary findings from the parent grant suggest that regression-based cut-point methods lack the accuracy required to provide valid point estimates of total and physical activity energy expenditure in field-based studies. Recently, pattern recognition approaches have been shown to be feasible and accurate using count data collected in 1-second increments by the widely used Actigraph accelerometer. The overarching goal of this competitive revision is to apply novel pattern recognition or machine learning data processing techniques to estimate physical activity type and intensity from high resolution accelerometer count data collected in children and adolescents as part of the ongoing parent grant. The proposed new aims are as follows: 1) To formulate and apply pattern recognition data processing techniques (multivariate hidden Markov models) to predict physical activity type and intensity from 1-second accelerometer count data collected in an age-diverse cohort children and adolescent; and 2) to compare the accuracy of physical activity intensity predictions provided by pattern recognition data processing techniques and traditional regression-based cut-point methods at baseline, and after 12-, 24-, and 36-months of follow-up.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents. Moreover, the new aims will inform the development of new computational approaches for predicting physical activity energy expenditure in free-living children and adolescents. This development will be particularly important for observational and experimental studies wishing to investigate the contributions of physical activity and sedentary behavior in the development and maintenance of childhood obesity.                Relevance to Public Health The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of smoking behavior.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

The device can provide the user and health professional feedback on the frequency of smoking and inhalation patterns (such as depth of inhalation and smoke holding) throughout the day in their home and community. This information can be used to inform behavioral strategies in smoking cessation programs.

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7825424,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2010,185505,0.06326688650407887
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,0.04724992992025156
"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.",Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring,8053612,R43AG034698,"['Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer Interface', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Employee Strikes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Floor', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heel', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Noise', 'Nursing Homes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Medicine', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retirement', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Virginia', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wood material', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'comparative', 'cost', 'digital', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'gait examination', 'human subject', 'minimally invasive', 'operation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vibration', 'volunteer']",NIA,EMPIRICAL TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION,R43,2010,113956,0.008995636764169142
"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7847964,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nose', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2009,11376,0.026032248455070784

"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally. The specific aims of this proposal address the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset, determining functional correlates of optic nerve damage, and characterizing glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels.

The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7537117,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Compatible', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,97690,0.026032248455070784
"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7287365,R44AG024687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Copyright', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Outsourcing', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Privacy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'network models', 'patient home care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2007,378793,0.0011289303629228318

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration .By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wirelessaccelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at thehip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometerswill be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permiting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available.

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects.

"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models.

"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             n/a",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7197865,R21NR009864,"['Hispanic Americans', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'focus groups', 'lifestyle', 'public health']",NINR,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2006,210300,-0.00222546220981449

In September 2003, NIH announced a new ""Roadmap"" to accelerate advances in biomedical research for the 21st century. Three areas listed in this Roadmap are relevant to this research proposal: (1) Interdisciplinary research training. (2) Clinical research informatics. (3) Development of enabling technologies for improved assessment of clinical outcomes. The Roadmap emphasizes coordinated strategies to develop both technological and human resources to take full advantage of multidisciplinary and translational research opportunities. This proposal addresses the stated training objectives at an individual level.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Visual field assessment and optic nerve head imaging (confocal scanning laser tomography) are commonly used to diagnose the disease and monitor its progression, yet there is considerable controversy about how to interpret and make best use of this information. Currently, raw data from these observations are reduced to statistical indices that are meant to summarize clinically meaningful features and provide a basis for classifying test results as normal or not. Unfortunately, these indices may sacrifice other relevant features in the data for interpretability.  We will use mathematical modeling methods (polynomial modeling, spline fitting and wavelet analysis) to quantify patterns in visual field data and topographic images of the optic nerve head. We will use features derived from these modeling methods to apply novel pattern recognition techniques from computer and information sciences-decision trees and non-linear regression analysis-and then compare these techniques to current methods to identify glaucoma. By improving current methods of analysis we can provide a more quantitative basis for clinical decisions, and offer greater consistency and objectivity on data interpretation.

"Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The project, Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI), seeks to improve glaucoma diagnosis and management with state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. These classifiers will automate the interpretation of standard automated perimetry (SAP), newer visual field tests, and structural tests for glaucoma in the general population and in stratified glaucoma populations. Phase 1 will complete the feasibility testing already underway. Phase 2 will apply the refined methods to a wider set of glaucoma testing problems.The management of glaucoma depends on a series of classifications. The glaucoma provider classifies tests as normal or indicative of glaucoma. The clinician then determines whether an eye has glaucoma or has had progression. Assembling these classifications, the provider makes decisions about management. Automated test interpreters, either as part of the testing machine or as a computer-based resource, can aid glaucoma providers with real-time interpretations. The research we propose takes advantage of our extensive data sets and builds on the ongoing research in our laboratories.Statistical classifiers, Bayesian nets, machine learning classifiers, and expert systems represent different types of classifiers with diverse properties. Machine learning classifiers can perform exceptionally well at identifying classes, even when the data are complex and have dependencies. We will test and select the optimal machine learning classifier for diagnosis. We will further improve classifier performance and determine feature utility by optimizing the feature set visual field tests are time consuming and stressful. We will streamline the tests by removing unimportant test points.Even with decades of experience, there is uncertainty with regard to the evaluation of the SAP. There is less accumulated knowledge about non-standard tests, such as short-wavelength automated perimetry, nerve fiber layer thickness, or optic nerve head topography. Machine classifiers may learn how to interpret nonstandard tests better. We will go beyond STATPAC's capabilities with classifiers that have learned to interpret SAP, nonstandard visual field tests, structural glaucoma tests, and STATPAC plots in the general population and in patients stratified by race, family history, and other information available at the time of the test.Conversion of suspects to glaucoma and progression of glaucoma cannot yet be predicted from tests. We will develop classifiers for these predictions. Classifiers will be designed to diagnose early glaucoma, detect early progression, and identify glaucomatous eyes at risk of progression.Unsupervised learning provides cluster analysis that can determine distinct groups with members in some way similar from the test data. In an effort to discover new and use useful information with unsupervised learning, we will mine our data in visual function and structural tests for glaucoma  and in specific combinations of population groups. n/a",Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI),6937074,R33EY013928,"['clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'glaucoma', 'glaucoma test', 'human subject', 'neural information processing', 'neuropathology', 'visual fields']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R33,2005,606534,0.031534028042500294
"Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system that can automatically detect bouts of moderate or greater walking and deliver health behavior change information to users to increase their levels of physical activity will be developed and evaluated. The system will be an extension of work already performed by the investigators, and will incorporate a validated wireless motion sensor, pattern classification software to identify bouts of walking, and a personified, relational user interface designed to maintain engagement and trust in the tailored behavior change information delivered to users over multiple interactions. The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.

"Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system that can automatically detect bouts of moderate or greater walking and deliver health behavior change information to users to increase their levels of physical activity will be developed and evaluated. The system will be an extension of work already performed by the investigators, and will incorporate a validated wireless motion sensor, pattern classification software to identify bouts of walking, and a personified, relational user interface designed to maintain engagement and trust in the tailored behavior change information delivered to users over multiple interactions. The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.       In the proposed effort the components of the PDA-based system will be developed, integrated and tested, and a randomized pilot study conducted to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the PDA-based behavior change intervention for increasing walking; 2) evaluate the effect of timeliness of health behavior change information on walking (time of need vs. retrospective); and 3) compare the efficacy of the personified user interface with that of a text-based interface for delivering health behavior change information on a PDA.

"Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The project, Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI), seeks to improve glaucoma diagnosis and management with state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers.

"Diagnostic Aid Software for Visual Field Test    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual Field (VF) test is a widely used, noninvasive technique for evaluating pathology or dysfunction in the visual pathways. The VF test, in conjunction with other diagnostics, is used for detection of early stages of glaucoma and for following its progression. Early detection is critical as blindness from glaucoma is preventable in nearly all cases, provided treatment is administered early in the progression. However, the inherent subjectivity of the VF test makes it often difficult to interpret even for a skilled practitioner. There is a need for automated decision aid tool that will facilitate and standardize the interpretation task.   In Phase 1 of this project, IAC will design and implement novel software algorithms to automate the interpretation of VF test data for detection of glaucoma. The software will classify VF test data into normal, borderline glaucomatous, glaucomatous and unknown (not normal or glaucomatous). The aim is to provide classification performance close to that of a highly skilled human expert. The emphasis will be on the detection of early stages of glaucoma. In addition to the classification output, the software will produce a set of comprehensive rules that will explain the decision path leading to the suggested diagnosis.         n/a",Diagnostic Aid Software for Visual Field Test,6582662,R43EY014077,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' early diagnosis', ' glaucoma', ' glaucoma test', ' human data', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' vision tests', ' visual fields']",NEI,INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION CORPORATION,R43,2003,99681,-0.01608574912894107

"Long Term Glucose Sensing & Physiologic Insulin Delivery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 4 million individuals with Type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin in the U.S. individual with diabetes are constantly challenged to measure their blood glucose and administer the appropriate insulin dose to achieve tight glucose control. Tight glucose control, achievable with intensive insulin therapy, dramatically reduces secondary complication of diabetes, but requires frequent painful blood samples and increases the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, individuals with the disease have long awaited an automatic closed-loop system that would control their glucose without the need for constant intervention. In the present proposal, two closed-loop systems to achieve this goal are developed. Both systems use a long-term fully implantable glucose sensor. One of the systems links the sensor to a fully implantable intraperitoneal insulin pump; the second links the sensor to an external insulin delivery pump. It is anticipated that some patients may require the implantable pump and that others will want to have the option of which pump to use. The systems have a common goal - to emulate, as closely as possible; glucose control achieved in a healthy individual. To achieve this goal, a physiology-insulin-delivery algorithm is proposed that emulates B-cell responses to glucose observed in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. The B-cell response is optimally adjusted to overcome delays associated with intraperitoneal (fully implanted pump) or subcutaneous (external pump) insulin delivery. Digital filters are developed to optimally remove noise in the sensor signal. A method of tuning the system, consistent with the level of glucose tolerance achieved by the B-cell is developed. Performance and safety of each system is evaluated. If successful, the systems can be expected to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes by dramatically reducing the burden placed on individuals with type 1 diabetes, and by reducing the costs of treating hypoglycemia and secondary complications.         n/a",Long Term Glucose Sensing & Physiologic Insulin Delivery,6588873,R01DK064567,"['artificial endocrine pancreas', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' biosensor device', ' clinical research', ' dogs', ' human subject', ' implant', ' insulin', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' pancreatic islets']",NIDDK,MEDTRONIC MINIMED,R01,2002,664917,-0.002545770261376219
"A Personal Status Monitor for the Home The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The MA will primarily augment clinical service by making the line an effective place for rehabilitation. In addition, the PSM will have direct applicability to the field of ergonomics for work-site assessment, or in sports or recreational activities as a feedback device to facilitate training of skilled movements.

"A PERSONAL STATUS MONITOR FOR THE HOME We propose to develop and evaluate a wireless Personal Status Monitor (PSM) that can monitor the use of musculature in a continuous and unobstructive fashion while a subject performs normal and usual daily activities in the home. This innovation will provide the caregiver specific information describing their patient's physical and functional performance in the home, without relying on self-reports or having the patient leave the home environment. The PSM will consist of three components: I) wireless sensors to detect the electromyographic (BMG) signal, 2) a small body-worn transceiver, and 3) a base station, which processes the signals for feature extraction and transmission to the caregiver. The proposed Phase l program will focus on the development of methods to recognize specific functional tasks based solely on surface EMG signals. We propose to develop and evaluate pattern recognition algorithms using neural networks for processing EMG signals obtained from healthy subjects during the performance of specific functional tasks selected from the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Proof of concept will be achieved by demonstrating that it is possible to accurately distinguish between these tasks using no more than 4 EMG sensors, even when extraneous motor activity is present. The commercial development of a PSM for the home will be continued during Phase II by: 1) designing and building the hardware, 2) developing the application software, and 3) expanding the development of intelligent algorithms to additional functional activities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development of a new method for monitoring functional activity in the home. The innovation will rely on technological achievements involving wireless sensors and telemedicine to surpass the capability of current methods to measure functional activity in the home. It will replace, or augment, the current reliance on self-report questionnaires, non-specific physical activity monitors, and frequent home care or clinic visits to establish a patient record of physical activity in the home.

"CLINICAL RESEARCH TOWARD CLOSED LOOP INSULIN DELIVERY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The ""closed-loop                artificial pancreas,"" a device that would measure glucose level and              deliver insulin automatically as needed, has been an elusive goal in the         treatment of diabetes. There are three essential components: the blood           glucose sensor, linking algorithms and the delivery system. For the first        time, a viable sensor and a proven delivery system are now available for         research. The broad goal of this clinical research proposal is to complete       the studies needed to link the sensor to the delivery system, paving the         way for a functional closed-loop artificial pancreas. First, we will make        a detailed analysis of sensor signal as it reflects glucose level in             normal and diabetic humans. Second, we will study the precise                    pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery by external and implantable insulin         pumps. Third, analysis of these two data sets will provide the basis for         algorithms that link the sensor signal to insulin delivery. A formal             safety analysis will evaluate the safety features needed in a closed loop        device. In the last year of the project, the entire system will be tested        and fine-tuned. This project takes advantage of our relatively extensive         investigational experience with mechanical insulin delivery pumps in             people with diabetes, and the recent availability, for research, of a            subcutaneously placed, glucose oxidase-based continuous glucose sensor.          The investigators have established experienced with clinical research in         diabetes, and the resources of an excellent General Clinical Research            Center. The co-investigators have extensive experience with mathematical         modeling of biologic systems. There is a close working relationship              between the research team and the manufacturer of the sensor and pumps, as       reflected by the Interactive Research Project Grant collaboration, and by        a long-standing history of collaboration. It is essential to emphasize           that we do not anticipate completion of a manufacturable, clinically             usable, commercially viable artificial pancreas within the time-frame of         this work. Rather, we aim to complete the basic studies and modeling             analyses that would form the basis of such a system, and demonstrate the         feasibility of linking the sensor to the delivery device. If these studies       and these trials were successful, they would be a major step towards             development of a clinically useful close-loop artificial pancreas.                n/a",CLINICAL RESEARCH TOWARD CLOSED LOOP INSULIN DELIVERY,6177804,R01DK055132,"['artificial endocrine pancreas', ' artificial intelligence', ' biosensor device', ' clinical research', ' drug delivery systems', ' glucose metabolism', ' human subject', ' insulin', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' medical implant science', ' pharmacokinetics']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,252566,0.007892994023215787
"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9839684,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,532467,0.016998874805735066
"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10043768,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'structured data', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,253379,0.03970858759690869
"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss. This study seeks to refine and validate a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of glaucoma on optic disc photographs and subsequently test it in a pilot teleophthalmology program.",Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology,9868507,K23EY030897,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Nature', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perimetry', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Suspect Glaucomas', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Width', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'career', 'carina', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experience', 'eye center', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'learning network', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health intervention', 'responsible research conduct', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,195131,0.030769658592667438
"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

"A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change. Project Summary/Abstract Behaivior is developing a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearables (like an advanced FitBit) and artificial intelligence. Knowing in real time when someone with opioid use disorder is at a high risk of relapsing revolutionizes the ability to intervene at the right moment to help people stay sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high risk opioid craving/obsession state and enabled the creation of a predictive model for just in time intervention. The number of deaths from opioid overdose is increasing every day, so reducing opioid addiction relapses will save lives and families and it will reduce rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations. Over 23 million Americans are addicted to drugs and alcohol, and these addictions cost the U.S. $442 billion per year, according to the US Surgeon General’s office. The majority of treatment tools used to keep those in recovery sober have low or mixed success rates. Many people in recovery end up relapsing multiple times, with the heroin relapse rate around 90%. With the technology that we are developing, Behaivior will detect if someone in recovery is in a red alert craving or “obsession” state and then, using artificial intelligence, we will provide support in real time by connecting someone to a support network member and/or provide a customized digital intervention. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human brain’s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks. Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains resources. This team uses machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial focus is opioids, this unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions, resulting in cost and health benefits across many populations. Project Narrative Behaivior is developing a system to predict and prevent opioid addiction relapses and overdoses using wearables and artificial intelligence for timely interventions. Our innovation lowers relapse and overdose rates and improves treatment adherence, which we anticipate will mitigate pain points such as higher treatment costs insurers currently pay from patient relapses, will reduce emergency room and first responder costs, and will ease (or alleviate) employers’ pain points such as poorer employee productivity and the added training and replacement costs. Through this program, Team Behavior will explore how to best tailor our technology for our likely first payers and validate the next potential customer segment we should pursue.","A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change.",10085849,R43DA046149,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Binge Eating', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Devices', 'Employee', 'Family', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heroin', 'Human', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Obsession', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'addiction', 'anger management', 'behavior change', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'first responder', 'fitbit', 'global health', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rearrest', 'reincarceration', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'success', 'sugar', 'support network', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'unsafe driving', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDA,"BEHAIVIOR, LLC",R43,2020,55000,-0.032997965169787626
"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology.

"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'memory care', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,-0.0003773940053546475
"Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Project Abstract / Summary Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United States will increase to over 3.3 million in 2020 and worldwide to an estimated 111.8 million by 2040. POAG is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Over the past several years, spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SDOCT) has become the standard tool for measuring structure in POAG. This 3D imaging modality provides a wealth of information about retinal structure and POAG-related retinal layers. This large amount of data is hard for clinicians to interpret and use effectively to help guide treatment decisions. Instead, summary metrics such as average layer thicknesses are used to reduce SDOCT images to a handful of values. While these metrics are useful, they can be difficult to interpret and they throwaway important information regarding voxel intensity and texture, relationships across retinal layers, and the overall 3D structure of the retina. Relying too heavily on these metrics limits our ability to gain a deeper understanding structural contributions to POAG, the relationship between structure and visual function, and how structural (and functional) changes progress in POAG. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, however, offer new data-driven tools and techniques to interpret 3D SDOCT images and learn from the large SDOCT datasets being collected in clinics around the world. This proposal will apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to 3D SDOCT data in order to (1) develop more accurate POAG detection tools, (2) reveal structure-function relationships, and (3) predict structural and functional progression in POAG. This proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, and a multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Robert Weinreb (Ophthalmology), Dr. David Kriegman (Computer Science and Engineering), and Dr. Armin Schwartzman (Biostatistics). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will the provide the PI with highly sought- after skills and experience to help ensure a successful transition into independence. Project Narrative Three-dimensional imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography have become an essential tool in the clinical care of glaucoma and other eye diseases. These imaging techniques provide clinicians with huge amounts of structural information, but interpreting the data and using it effectively to improve outcomes remains challenging in clinical glaucoma management. This project will improve patient care by applying powerful deep learning techniques to provide clinicians with critical decision support information to more accurately detect glaucoma, reveal associations between structure and visual function, and predict glaucoma progression.",Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography,10055661,K99EY030942,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Frequencies', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Probability', 'Progressive Disease', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'South Korea', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'college', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'field study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'legally blind', 'macula', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'three dimensional structure', 'tomography', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,117347,0.002201557407648177
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,9943875,R01EY031331,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,341800,-0.012653169053329314
"TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC. Cancer patients experience substantial functional impairments during and after treatments, often requiring rehabilitation and exercise interventions. However, a functional assessment of the specific deficits and impairments in the individual is needed to inform exercise therapy. The oncology workforce is challenged in its capacity to conduct such functional assessment, therefore limiting the ability of rehabilitation providers to identify and meet the needs of these individuals. This work seeks to develop a novel, low-cost PC/camera-based image/video-monitoring system that can a) continuously and unobtrusively monitor the physical health of a cancer patient in his/her natural environment, b) determine the existence and extent of functional deficits, and c) facilitate personalized rehabilitative interventions, providing a risk-stratified and personalized approach to cancer patient care. Based on patient’s daily activities or exercises, objective and quantitative clinically-relevant and laboratory-validated measures of physical performance (e.g., gait speed, balance, and fall risk) will be extracted by using state-of-the-art image-processing and machine-learning techniques, involving human-detection, pose-estimation, and deep-learning algorithms and fall-risk prediction models. By providing the patients and their clinicians with a real-time assessment of their physical performance, through a PCbased software and a Web portal, respectively, the system will facilitate proactive rehabilitation via clinician-approved, personalized health-care tips and exercise recommendations. n/a",TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC.,10267589,5N91020C00042,"['Aftercare', 'Automation', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Oncology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical assessment', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'functional disability', 'image processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized health care', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'risk prediction model', 'software systems', 'web portal']",NCI,"INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION, INC.",N43,2020,399961,-0.0006596869192845698
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9829561,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2020,165045,0.014158128664812614
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9952373,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal macula', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'retina circulation', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564228,0.05800965853388128
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,0.025005771726544616
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9963258,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,508751,0.006050430184586387
"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10047364,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,241500,0.019703412047259988
"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology. Project Narrative The proposed research will study the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) optic nerve head (ONH) related structure and glaucoma.

"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10131449,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'combat', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2020,457208,0.025512537715104363
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,0.009302692215144182
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",9944107,R01EY031394,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Computer software', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intraocular pressure test', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Optic Nerve Transections', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Veins', 'Velocimetries', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'attenuation', 'automated segmentation', 'central retinal artery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolic rate', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'response', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retina circulation', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal ischemia', 'traditional therapy', 'vascular factor']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,552591,0.02710570813047171
"Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users Project Summary Elderly wheelchair users experience wheelchair breakdowns every 2-3 months in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and rural areas of high-income countries. One in three breakdowns leads to adverse physical, social, psychosocial and economic consequences to wheelchair users which increases the public health and personal burden. Preventative wheelchair maintenance has been found to reduce the frequency of wheelchair breakdowns by ten-fold, but compliance with maintenance recommendations is extremely low because they are generic and not reflective of how and where the wheelchair is being used. To address this issue, we are developing a low-cost, scalable maintenance application that leverages artificial intelligence tools to provide maintenance recommendations tailored to how a wheelchair is used. The availability of low-cost technology and widespread use of smartphones by the elderly and people with disabilities in LMICs has led us to develop a smartphone application called WheelTrak that measures wheelchair wear as a function of usage in community. Based on the wear factors, the application produces a Wheelchair Wear Index (WWI) that is representative of wear of critical wheelchair parts that are prone to breakdown. Once a WWI threshold is reached, maintenance is required, and the application notifies the user and/or caregiver who can conduct maintenance to avoid breakdowns and related health consequences. We will conduct a data collection study in collaboration with our wheelchair industry partner – UCP Wheels in El Salvador – and characterize the WWI for the elderly by tracking wear factors which include user’s travel distance, ground shocks and surface vibrations using WheelTrak and a wheel sensor. Based on the trained WWI algorithm, a preventative maintenance schedule will be developed for older adults that can be employed through WheelTrak for maintenance reminders. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the application and gather barriers to maintenance. User feedback will assist us in improving WheelTrak for greater user satisfaction and compliance with maintenance, and addressing any personal or logistical challenges that elderly users and their caregivers or family members may face with conducting maintenance activities in LMICs. Findings from the proposed studies in this application will assist us in planning future studies to investigate the WWI-enabled WheelTrak tool as an intervention to prevent or reduce breakdowns and health consequences with the elderly in LMICs. Preventative maintenance of wheelchairs is necessary to reduce frequent wheelchair breakdowns and corresponding health consequences experienced by the elderly in adverse environments which are commonly present in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). WheelTrak is a smartphone application that measures real-time wheelchair wear in the community during use and triggers preventative maintenance reminders. In this study, we are modelling the application algorithm and collecting user and caregiver feedback to transform WheelTrak into a maintenance intervention tool for elderly wheelchair users in LMICs.",Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users,10095020,R03AG069836,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Economics', 'El Salvador', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Income', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care', 'Maintenance', 'Manual wheelchair', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Notification', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'User Compliance', 'Wheelchairs', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'low and middle-income countries', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2020,75877,-0.00952845412219041
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future. Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s affects millions of individuals, at a great cost to public health and personal well-being. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in- person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access.

"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,0.043203421161146116
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10019455,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,290216,-0.01133663475911905
"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Immobilization', 'Implant', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Older Population', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Skin Temperature', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sports Medicine', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Swelling', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'healing', 'high risk', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'physical therapist', 'post-operative rehabilitation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'rotator cuff tear', 'sensor', 'success', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'wireless communication']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,-0.01458249564647292
"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dietitian', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hyperphagia', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'design', 'drinking', 'image processing', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication nonadherence', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'privacy preservation', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,0.020207692518063227
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,10003222,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'algorithm training', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,640068,-0.01107922392928473
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10019477,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,200000,0.009982591406584588
"Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of hospitalization in the US. Exacerbations - a worsening or “flare up” of symptoms - cause most COPD hospitalizations. Since most exacerbations can be treated with changes of inhalers and/or oral medications, at-home detection of lung function deterioration may facilitate earlier intervention and help delay or prevent hospitalizations. The Standards of Care for monitoring lung function are spirometry, plethysmography, and CT scan. However, these are expensive methods and unsuited for continuous monitoring or at-home use. Various patient self-monitoring approaches have been tried, for example, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate monitoring, and peak flow metering, but their efficacy in reducing hospitalizations has been limited.  A common finding for all forms of COPD is air trapping, defined, as an abnormal increase in the volume of air remaining in the lungs after exhalation is complete. A body of evidence definitively shows that air trapping increases during exacerbations and decreases when exacerbations resolve. Recent reports show that air trapping is an earlier harbinger of deteriorating lung function than spirometric changes, and can be measured by low-frequency ultrasound (1-40 kHz). Acoustic monitoring of air trapping could provide clinicians with a non- invasive tool when medical intervention is needed to avoid unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations.  Respira Labs has developed a low-cost, non-invasive, acoustic-based wearable device that can continually monitor lung resonance: Sylvee. The device uses known acoustic-based technology with machine- learning algorithms to detect minor changes in lung resonance, which our preliminary results suggest correspond to changes in air trapping. The overall objective of this project is to validate Sylvee's air trapping algorithms in a cohort of 20 healthy controls and 40 COPD patients with and without air trapping, respectively. In Aims 1 and 2, we will miniaturize and add sensors to the Sylvee device and develop a user interface (UI) and a mobile application. In Aims 3 and 4, we will create an Air Trapping Index Report and validate it in a cross-sectional study vis-à-vis whole body plethysmography as a control. Results of this project provide a go/no-go development decision based on device function. We can apply these results in STTR Phase II, in a larger clinical study to evaluate Sylvee as an at-home monitoring system, with a goal of reducing hospitalizations by at least 30%. Ultimately, Sylvee will allow physicians to remotely monitor their patients' lung function and adjust their medications to reduce healthcare costs and improve patients' quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than 12 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, and another 17 million may have COPD, but are unaware of it. By 2020, the costs associated with COPD are estimated to be $72B billion per year, of which with ~50% are the costs of spent on ER visits and hospitalizations. The goal of this proposal is to establish and validate a seamless and non-obtrusive wearable that measures abnormal air trapping via a novel acoustic technology, which would reduce hospitalizations through at-home monitoring of lung function.","Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD",10080272,R41HL152769,"['Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Bluetooth', 'Bronchoconstriction', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Bronchitis', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Edema', 'Emergency department visit', 'Exhalation', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Miniaturization', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous body substance', 'Noise', 'Oral', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Particulate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Veterans', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'Wireless Technology', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air monitoring', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'novel', 'ozone exposure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"RESPIRA LABS, LLC",R41,2020,350000,-0.05808280566312567
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9990732,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,623237,0.01087473648607999
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,0.023776210427575422
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI.

"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9913546,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521102,-0.007298376587880427
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9924432,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,298890,0.026943526532378446
"Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee Overview We propose to develop a design space framework and co-design methodology for the development of assistive self-care robot technologies that are informed by the social model of disability. Our model of assistive robots in the domain of self-care considers an individual's social and environmental context, coping processes and other factors that can affect independent functioning. Our design methods utilize embedded sensing to intelligently respond to these con- siderations. We speciﬁcally focus on assistive feeding tasks, proposing a formalism that enables a robotic system to feed a person with upper-extremity disability. Our guiding principle is that human-level interaction is feasible only if the robot itself relies on human-level semantics. We im- plement this principle by relying on data to learn and develop object-dependent control policies and timing models for acquiring and transferring a bite to a user at a proper time. The system's ob- server detects world states and arbitrator invokes different control policies based on these states. The tangible result will be an intelligent assistive feeding robot whose performance can generalize to different activities, adapt to user preferences, and recover from failures. Objectives and Relevance to NIH A design framework for assistive robots would provide for- malisms that let us address the fundamental challenge of designing robots that are responsive to context of use and support assisted self-care in a variety of social settings. We combine method- ologies from human-robot interaction, cognitive science, machine learning, robotics and haptics with user studies and our formalism to address the following research questions: (Q1) Mechanics of Feeding-Control Policies: How can control policies be designed for dexterous non-prehensile manipu- lation of deformable objects such as food? (Q2) Social Aspects of Feeding-Bite Timing: How should an assistive feeding robot decide the right timing for feeding a user? (Q3) Human-in-the-Loop: How can human-directed feedback be added into the loop for an autonomous assistive feeding system?  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks. This can in turn help them increase their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. While we presently focus on this spe- ciﬁc application, the tools and insights we gain can generalize to the ﬁelds of robotic assistance and human-robot interaction across other activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Thus, our work is clearly motivated by the intent to improve the quality of health and life of the aging population and is very relevant to the theme of NIH. 1 Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks, potentially increasing their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. The long-term promise of this research is to have robots in society that are able to seamlessly and ﬂuently perform complex manipulation tasks in dynamic human environments in real homes which could impact individuals with other disabilities as well as able-bodied individuals. Through improved access to independent living and customizing to the unique needs and preferences of users, the results of this project can positively impact mil- lions of people worldwide, especially given the vast variability in our target population by being transformational in the scalability of assistive robotics for self-care. 1",Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities,9907705,F32HD101192,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Bathing', 'Bite', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Eating', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Systems', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Improve Access', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Panthera leo', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Sterile coverings', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'aging population', 'assistive robot', 'base', 'care recipients', 'coping', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'haptics', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'intergenerational', 'kinematics', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'preference', 'robot assistance', 'robotic system', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2020,65310,-0.010518962728258778
"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse.

"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults. Results will be used to build more predictive health behavior theories and inform personalized behavior interventions to reduce obesity and improve public health.",Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance,9985623,U01HL146327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Voice', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'demographics', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'emerging adulthood', 'ethnic diversity', 'improved', 'lifetime risk', 'mobile computing', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'sleep behavior', 'smart watch', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'trend', 'weight gain prevention']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2020,563609,0.02984924991322922
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9906897,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'privacy preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,505658,0.02174805114446938
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9942461,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,391938,0.011122393756734043
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9994897,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,41640,0.04048482560500981
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10003374,K23HD096134,"['Address', 'Biomechanics', 'Caregiver support', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coin', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personnel Management', 'Physical activity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Secondary to', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'muscle strength', 'neurological recovery', 'opportunity cost', 'patient mobility', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sensor', 'translational study', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,132314,0.005969129512822036
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,0.0018067979369717243
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores.

"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10018290,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blindness', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Track and Field', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data integration', 'early onset', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'flexibility', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable device']",OD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP5,2020,393957,0.04236144949642043
"Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. The number of people with primary open angle glaucoma is expected to exceed 100 million by 2040. The first-line therapy for glaucoma treatment is patient-administered hypotensive medication delivered topically via an eye drop. However, studies have consistently shown that patients rarely adhere to dosing recommendations. According to the Wilmer Glaucoma Center of Excellence, nearly 50% of individuals discontinue eye drops within six months of their first prescription. Of those that persist beyond six months, only 37% continue the therapy after three years, and only 10% of those prescribed glaucoma drops are persistent (without gaps) over the first year. Failure to adhere to dosing recommendations dramatically limits the effectiveness of eye drops in lowering intraocular pressure and delaying or preventing the progression of glaucoma. This well-known problem has prompted the development of several technological solutions for tracking adherence. Retinal Care's proposed solution is fundamentally different. The proposed device is a simple and inexpensive combination of sensors designed to provide feedback to patients, providers, payers, and care coordinators regarding the way a patient interacts with their medication. Tactile and motion data is acquired through a custom force-sensitive resistor (FSR) and a standard three-axis accelerometer. Combined, these two data sources provide significant insight into drop adherence, application mechanics, and patient behavior. More importantly, this data can inform decisions on how and when to intervene with a patient to maximize the likelihood of continued long-term drop adherence and vision preservation. The primary innovations are in the single-use design (enabled by low-cost custom FSR fabrication and the unique combination of low-cost electrical components), the novel mining of motion and tactile information for patient adherence and behavioral data, and the integration with an existing care coordination framework. Retinal Care approaches health care more holistically than traditional companies; recognizing the behavioral and psychosocial factors that are a root cause of blindness from eye diseases like glaucoma. While Retinal Care employs cutting-edge technology such as deep learning and advanced medical devices, we work actively toward implementing technology in a way that translates directly to improved quality of life for our patients by managing the entire care path. The technology proposed here, while novel in design, is not intended primarily as a tracking tool, though it will accomplish that sub-goal with greater effectiveness and at less cost than any existing product. Instead, it is designed explicitly to reduce blindness by providing the crucial data needed to tailor our interaction and intervention strategies to the individual patient; to maximize patient engagement and adherence to glaucoma care through a combination of education, incentivization, tailored communications, and personal interaction with our trained care coordinators. The goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility (cost and functionality) of the simple device that will enable Retinal Care to effectively reduce blindness and visual impairment from glaucoma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally and in the US, where it affects more than 3 million Americans and costs the US economy $2.86 billion every year in direct costs and productivity losses. Topical medication administered through eye drops is a common and effective first-line therapy for reducing intraocular pressure and controlling glaucoma, but patient adherence to dosing recommendations is a consistent and pervasive issue that contributes significantly to vision loss. Retinal Care Inc. intends to develop and deploy a suite of simple, disposable, bottle-integrated sensors that will continuously collect real-time adherence and behavioral data to inform the design of patient-specific intervention and incentivization strategies to improve adherence and reduce blindness from glaucoma.","Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement",10010396,R41EY031632,"['Accelerometer', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coin', 'Communication', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Direct Costs', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nylons', 'Ophthalmology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plant Roots', 'Polyurethanes', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Retina', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Topical application', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'care coordination', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'incentive strategies', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'patient engagement', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'productivity loss', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2020,219896,0.025599447530696446
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9938564,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,355478,0.058798377980550307
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9899101,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,572773,0.05692585604288994

"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways.

"Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression Phase IIB Abstract -FINAL A large body of evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of mood symptoms and full-blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely, that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to enhance our capacity to monitor and treat such conditions, with a particular emphasis on mood disorders. Our product vision capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to automatically and continuously sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of depressive symptomatology captured on a 24/7 basis in the user’s natural environment. It also capitalizes on the capacity of smartphones to deliver interventions that are easily accessible, can be delivered with optimal timing and, perhaps most important, are enormously scalable. Finally, smartphone technology gives us the capacity to bring empirically validated psychosocial interventions to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such interventions and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse. Under the auspices of our Phase II SBIR funding (R44MH113520-01-02), we have developed both such a monitoring product (Measure) and have developed and tested such a digital intervention platform (Cue). Analyses conducted to date indicate that Cue leads to significantly greater decreases in depressive symptomatology than monitoring alone via Measure. We now propose to: 1) upgrade to Cue and its accompanying clinician dashboard to be commercially marketable and 2) carry out the clinical trial necessary for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0 as a mobile device. Cue 2.0 will include enhanced designs, more in-depth psychoeducational material, and a fully automated engine for delivering behavior change suggestions to improve the regularity of users’ social and behavioral routines. Building on the accomplishments of our Phase II funding, this SBIR Phase IIB proposal is focused on bringing Cue to market as a scientifically validated and profitable digital intervention for individuals with depression with or without co-occurring anxiety disorder. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Develop and validate Cue 2.0 a fully automated digital intervention platform. Aim 2: Carry out all necessary steps to apply for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0.  PROJECT NARRATIVE HealthRhythms, Inc. is on a mission to become the world leader in tracking clinically meaningful behavioral rhythms in order to provide automated behavior change suggestions to patients around the globe. The work we propose in this SBIR Phase IIB application will enable HealthRhythms to further develop Cue, our smartphone-based intervention platform for depression, and carry out the work necessary to obtain FDA clearance for Cue as a medical device. This will enable us to bring a tested psychosocial treatment to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such treatment and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse.",Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression,10081882,R44MH113520,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consultations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'convict', 'dashboard', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'intimate behavior', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mood symptom', 'prevent', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'usability']",NIMH,"HEALTH RHYTHMS, INC.",R44,2020,974672,-0.00443201208806965
"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[' '],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,-0.010186264104938695
"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome.,10013069,R41DA049615,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Temperature', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Engineering', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hydration status', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Property', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sneezing', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Sweating', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'care costs', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microchip', 'monitoring device', 'nanofabrication', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'neuromuscular activity', 'novel', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid withdrawal', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prenatal exposure', 'printed circuit board', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy duration', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,REKOVAR INC.,R41,2020,225000,0.004553799710014762
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,0.011574686247465852
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology Abstract  In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state- of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Although results were promising, the majority of participants still did not meet national guidelines for PA. In the ongoing renewal of R01CA159954, we will randomize 300 Latina women to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention).  The proposed supplement seeks to become the first trial to examine longitudinal patterns of PA adoption and maintenance across a series of longitudinal studies among Latinas. Traditional analytic methods would compare findings across studies and would estimate intervention effects at end of treatment controlling for baseline. We propose to use Integrative Data Analysis to combine data across studies and Latent Class Models to identifies patterns of PA adoption and maintenance. By using Latent Class Modeling (LCM), we will make full use of the longitudinal profile of PA data to identify patterns of change over time. LCMs use objective data (rather than a priori hypotheses) to subdivide the population into distinct groups of participants with similar profiles (of PA changes in this case). LCM can not only capture between- and within-subject heterogeneity, but can aid in the identification of meaningful subgroups within the population. By using this innovative method, we will not only reveal the inter-variability of PA over time but also elucidate the associations between such patterns and key psychosocial, behavioral and demographic predictors. Project Narrative Latinas exhibit high rates of inactivity and related chronic health conditions (including some cancers, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and are therefore in need of culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity interventions. The proposed supplement will build on the aims of the parent and renewal studies by using integrative data analysis to identify patterns of change in objectively measured physical activity over time, and test how these patterns relate to participant-level characteristics, including demographics, psychosocial and physiological predictors.",Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology,9764734,R01CA159954,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Endometrial', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latina', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'burden of illness', 'cancer risk', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'exercise intervention', 'group intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'post intervention', 'protective effect', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social culture', 'success', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigorous intensity']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,216895,0.03608481436469843
"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9977179,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,653880,0.015263399489985606
"Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates Summary/Abstract Each year, about 5-18% of babies are born preterm, accounting for over 0.5M births in the US and 15M globally. Many of these babies are admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) where the medical staff generally have the option of using either invasive arterial lines (IALs) or inflatable-cuff non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. The former introduces the risk of infection, tissue and nerve damage, and the latter is less accurate, especially for hypotensive infants, and may add the risk of ischemic and nerve damage upon repeated measurement. There is a clear need for a safer, continuous, and cost effective form of NIBP measurement to meet the challenge of managing unhealthy blood pressures for neonates. PyrAmes Inc. has developed a novel capacitive sensor technology that is paper thin and flexible and can accurately detect blood pressure (BP). This sensor technology is part of a unique continuous BP monitoring platform that provides accurate, lightweight and comfortable BP monitoring in a wireless, wrist-worn package that is easy to use. The system uses lightweight neural networks to analyze pulse waveform data to provide continuous determination of systolic, diastolic, and mean BP, heart rate, and their variabilities. The sensor is easy to apply non-invasively and records pulsatile data similar to an arterial line, while avoiding the difficulties of placing and maintaining an arterial line. This device can provide gold standard BP monitoring without perturbing the patients for more accurate and relevant measurements. The objective of this project is to extend the platform for use with term and pre-term neonates. This goal will be accomplished through redesign of the sensor hardware and optimization of the data analytics software. We will validate these modifications with clinical data from the NICU at Stanford University Medical Center. In Phase I, we will miniaturize the electronics and modify the sensor array of a wrist-worn pulse wave monitor to be sized more appropriately for neonates. We will validate the new device design by collecting NICU clinical data from patients who have IALs in place in an IRB-approved study. From IAL and sensor data taken simultaneously, we will determine ground truth values on a pulse-by-pulse basis and use these data in conjunction with additional IAL data from historical databases to improve our sensor quality and predictive BP models. Our success metric will be to equal or exceed the quality and accuracy of our data for adults. Phase II will be a follow-up IRB-approved pivotal study using the device from Phase 1 to position our device for FDA submission and clearance and scale up to pilot production of this device. Project Narrative The goal of this Phase 1 project is to confirm that machine learning can be used to extract blood pressure values for critically ill neonates from pulse waveform data collected with a wearable, non-invasive device that is comfortable, low-cost and easy to use. The proposed device will significantly reduce the need for frequent cuff-based measurements and/or invasive arterial lines, thereby decreasing morbidity, risk of complications, patient discomfort, and overall cost of care. This project is based on the pioneering efforts of Prof. Zhenan Bao’s lab at Stanford on thin film sensors for electronic skin and includes the design and use of a miniaturized device to collect clinical data from neonates that will be used to validate a model which derives blood pressure values from the pulse waveform without external calibration.",Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates,9910153,R43HD101175,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Area', 'Arterial Lines', 'Birth', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood pressure determination', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Coin', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronics', 'Female', 'Film', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Nerve', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Pain', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'encryption', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'light weight', 'male', 'miniaturize', 'neonate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pressure', 'preterm newborn', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'success', 'tonometry']",NICHD,"PYRAMES, INC.",R43,2020,224556,0.015998205751322367
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9934148,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2020,2195573,0.023540904577532957
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9732635,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'pedometer', 'physical model', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,183406,0.05141912034335486
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an integrated health coaching system that uses a smartphone app to promote healthy behaviors. We will adapt it for metabolic syndrome and evaluate its effectiveness in a corporate health setting.",HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME,10084515,R44HL142328,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Android', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Central obesity', 'Chronic', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employee Health', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Fasting', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical activity', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social support', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Water', 'Water consumption', 'Wellness Program', 'Workplace', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'contingency management', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'financial incentive', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'fruits and vegetables', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'social learning', 'standard care', 'sugar', 'sweetened beverage', 'usability', 'waist circumference', 'web-based assessment']",NHLBI,"HABIT DESIGN, INC.",R44,2020,726708,0.009086582573104256
