"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,10086077,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2021,161528
"uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the U.S. Substance use is an important influence on HIV risk among GBMSM; and partner seeking for both sex and substance use have largely moved online and to geosocial networking platforms designed for GBMSM (e.g., Grindr). Technological advances in the collection and mining of “big data” to inform behavioral health interventions have increased in recent years but have not been applied directly to HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction among GBMSM. At the same time, despite major advances in biomedical HIV prevention (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and substance use harm-reduction (i.e., medication assisted therapy [MAT]), these strategies are underutilized by GBMSM. My research team and I conducted formative research on social media data mining and machine learning through a NIDA A/START (R03) to identify patterns of technology use that are associated with HIV risk and substance use among GBMSM. We established computational functionality of a culturally tailored social media data mining program among substance using GBMSM. I now take an important scientific risk to use this technology to develop an HIV prevention intervention for GBMSM, tentatively titled uTECH, that leverages insights from machine learning to trigger personalized intervention content in order to increase biomedical HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction. Specifically, I propose to conduct a two-phase study. In Phase 1 I will conduct qualitative interviews with GBMSM to inform the iterative development and refinement of uTECH. In Phase 2, I will test the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of uTECH in a comparative implementation science trial. For this phase, I will (a) enroll racially diverse, HIV- negative, substance using GBMSM; (b) randomize them to either the uTECH intervention or a comparison group; and (c) measure acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility through 6 months post-intervention. My primary implementation science outcomes will be acceptability (i.e., Acceptability of Intervention Measure [AIM]), appropriateness (i.e., Intervention Appropriateness Measure [IAM]), and feasibility (i.e., Feasibility of Intervention Measure [FIM]). I believe that the power of “big data” and new technologies can be harnessed for effective HIV prevention with substance using GBMSM. In the era of increasing HIV prevention fatigue among GBMSM, the ability to deliver quick, convenient and highly personalized interventions presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and substance use is an important factor driving new HIV infections in this population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among GBMSM by refining and testing the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of an innovative, social media “big data” machine learning intervention, which aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies.",uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM,10400487,DP2DA049296,"['AIDS prevention', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bisexual', 'Collection', 'Development', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Gays', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV risk', 'Harm Reduction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'behavioral health intervention', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'data mining', 'design', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men who have sex with men', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'post intervention', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social media', 'transmission process']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2021,13728
"Leveraging large-scale administrative claims data to evaluate prescription opioid use, risks, and outcomes in older adults living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide support for me to become an independent investigator with a multidisciplinary research program in HIV at the intersection of prescription drug use, comorbidities, and aging. In this project, I propose to leverage existing administrative claims data from Medicare beneficiaries ≥65 years of age from 2007-2018 to determine how high-risk prescription opioid use, e.g. high dose use (≥120 mg/day) or prolonged use (≥90 days), affects health outcomes and health care utilization in older people living with HIV (PLWH). Building on my strong foundation in HIV epidemiology and HIV comorbidities across the lifespan, the training from this K01 will allow me to (1) obtain proficiency in the analysis of large-scale, longitudinal administrative claims data; (2) attain content expertise in prescription drug utilization research and pharmacoepidemiology; and (3) develop expertise in the application of machine learning methods. My career development plan includes specific coursework, seminars, conferences, directed readings, and tailored mentoring from a multidisciplinary team comprised of experts in administrative claims data, substance use epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, and machine learning methods. Rutgers University provides an exceptional environment for completion of this training, with research support and infrastructure for analyzing large, multiyear datasets (including Medicare claims) and conducting high-impact HIV research. The proposed research is significant given that a substantial gap exists in understanding how prescription opioid use affects a growing population of aging PLWH who commonly report chronic pain, and have multiple comorbidities, increasing polypharmacy, and increased risk for untoward drug-drug interactions. This research is critical to target appropriate prevention and treatment programs to optimize health outcomes for this population. To fill this gap, specific aims are to: (1) Assess the associations between HIV infection and a) adverse health outcomes (e.g. falls/fractures, dementia, mortality) and b) health care utilization (e.g. emergency department use, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient visits) among older adults, and estimate the interaction between HIV infection and high-risk prescription opioid use on adverse outcomes and utilization; (2) Among older PLWH, estimate drug-drug interactions between high-risk prescription opioid use and specific antiretroviral drug classes or sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines) on risk of adverse health outcomes and health care utilization; and (3) Examine the feasibility of applying existing machine learning approaches to predict adverse health outcomes and high health care utilization among older PLWH based on patient profiles and opioid prescription patterns in a large administrative claims database. Findings from this project will generate valuable new information and tools to support clinical decisions and more precisely target prevention and treatment interventions to improve health for older PLWH who are prescribed opioids, and directly inform an R01 application to study drug-drug and drug- disease interactions between widely used prescription drugs and common comorbidities among older PLWH. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with HIV (PLWH) commonly report chronic pain and are more likely to receive prescription opioids, placing them at elevated risk for adverse events. However, data are limited for a growing population of older PLWH 65+ years with multiple comorbidities, increasing polypharmacy, and increased risk for untoward drug- drug interactions. Using large-scale administrative claims data and machine learning approaches, this project will analyze prescription opioid use, risks, and outcomes in older PLWH, generating valuable new information and tools to support clinical decisions and more precisely target prevention and treatment interventions to improve health for older PLWH who use opioids.","Leveraging large-scale administrative claims data to evaluate prescription opioid use, risks, and outcomes in older adults living with HIV",10161305,K01DA053157,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Injecting drug user', 'Inpatients', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mental Health', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Older Population', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'career development', 'chronic pain', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'co-infection', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'falls', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'prescription opioid', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sedative', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIDA,RBHS-SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,195626
