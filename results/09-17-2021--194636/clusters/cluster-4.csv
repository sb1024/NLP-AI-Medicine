"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9713512,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,647706,-0.0017766907614405105
"AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space Project Summary  An extensible analysis platform will be developed to accurately perform the automated genotyping of PCR/capillary electrophoresis (CE) traces for multiple disease-associated short tandem repeater (STR) assays. This study will evaluate the feasibility of developing generalizable and adaptive molecular analysis models, and will ultimately establish a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space.  Advanced machine learning strategies will be applied to interpret genotypes of inherited disorders caused by genetically unstable STR DNA sequences. STRs have traditionally been difficult to investigate due to their length (on the order of kilobases) and low sequence complexity, which elude detection by traditional and next- generation sequencing technologies. However, advances in PCR/CE technology have enabled the amplification and fragment sizing of STR DNA fragments, advancing clinical research and diagnostic test development for several neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite these advances, the analysis of PCR/CE data from assays targeting STRs remains a manual, burdensome, and subjective process. There is a clear need to create a system that can scale with the development of new assays, and the proposed approach utilizes modern breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to fulfill that need.  This method will leverage recent advances in representation learning to establish a generalized and adaptive framework for automated PCR/CE annotation that can scale to new assays and improve automatically with the inclusion of new data. The project will benefit from Asuragen’s experience in optimizing repeat-primed chemistries to develop and commercialize multiple high performance assays including the AmplideX PCR/CE FMR1 kit. Importantly, the proposed modeling strategy will borrow-strength across multiple established PCR/CE assays and generalize to future PCR/CE assays for novel STR disease associated biomarkers. This system will be paramount to enabling a continuous learning platform wherein computationally-assisted annotation of PCR/CE assays can be continuously improved and integrated in to clinical research tools and diagnostics. Project Narrative  We are developing AmplideX DeepNet, an artificial intelligence-based analysis system that can accurately perform computationally-assisted analysis of molecular diagnostic assays. The proposed system will build upon recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to allow it to easily adapt to new assays and to continue to improve. The system will be applied to assays for several disorders, including fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myotonic dystrophy, and Huntington’s disease, and will provide a number of benefits over current analysis methods by reducing turn-around time for assay results and assuring reproducible reporting between operators and labs.","AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space",9678895,R43GM128498,"['Alleles', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'C9ORF72', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 repeat', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Huntington Disease', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical tool', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'experience', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'heuristics', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'learning progression', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'research and development', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,"ASURAGEN, INC.",R43,2019,269217,-0.029811539304998098
"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance. My research project will address a critical public health need by developing machine learning algorithms that are both accurate and interpretable, and apply them to solve specific clinical problems.",Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine,9743021,K08EB026500,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Radiotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Libraries', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Polynomial Models', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Structure', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'artificial neural network', 'asthmatic patient', 'classification trees', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'improved', 'information organization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'task analysis', 'theories']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2019,191912,-0.00941535140076589
"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9642922,R01LM012973,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,386910,-0.05456325702744145
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9645433,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,92070,-0.03914898191121488
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9687065,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'computerized data processing', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,448622,-0.032870097994017265
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9756832,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,250346,-0.016594166621492348
"Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces Project Summary Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have the potential to transform communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease through personalized and real-time augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. Individuals with severe communication impairments who can no longer control their daily conversations or participate in previous life roles want AAC devices. And they want them to work – to be reliable, effective, and fast. ML and NLP are emerging as promising tools to bridge current technology and next generation devices for individuals with the most severe speech and physical impairments, like the RSVP Keyboard™, a brain-computer interface (BCI) being developed by the parent grant. BCI systems for communication are referred to as AAC-BCIs. NLP efforts to combine large public data sets with private data sets, such as personal email messages, promise to give individuals with communication impairments their own personalized language models, models that are sufficiently robust to get closer to real-time communication. The focus on getting AAC-BCIs to work with machine learning, however, has led to a critical oversight in the field: an inadequate understanding of why individuals want next-generation devices and what trade-offs they are willing to make for faster and more personalized communication. The turn to ML brings this oversight into sharp relief. Individuals should provide input about the data sets used to construct their personal language models, but this raises important ethical questions about what individuals value, how they understand their identity, and what trade-offs they are willing to make relative to their personalized communication data. The goal of this supplement is to fill this gap in understanding so that researchers can implement ML into next generation AAC-BCI systems in a way that is sensitive to the ethical concerns of future users. There are four components to this ethics supplement: (1) to design a toolbox of ethics vignettes tailored to ethical concerns raised by both BCI communication and ML; (2) to administer monthly vignette-based online ethics surveys to individuals with severe communication impairments due to motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS) (n=25) or movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease) (n=25); (3) to conduct semi-structured vignette-based interviews with individuals with pre- clinical or mild communication impairment due to motor neuron disease (n=10) or movement disorder (n=10). Components (2) and (3) will employ an iterative, parallel mixed-method approach. Trends in Likert-style online responses to ethics vignettes in the severe communication impairment cohort will be used to inform and modify the semi-structured interview prompts asked of the pre-clinical or mild impairment cohort. In parallel, themes emerging from direct content analysis of interviews will be used to refine online survey questions. Results of this iterative, mix-methods approach will be used (4) to outline a framework of core ethical domains and preliminary tools (vignettes and discussion prompts) that AAC-BCI researchers can use to assess ethical concerns while developing and iteratively refining communication technology for personalized language models.

"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency.

"Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning Project Summary Development of general and efficient methods for functionalization of alcohols is highly warranted due to the ubiquity and prominence of this functional group in natural products. Such methods would allow for late-stage diversification of complex molecules and, consequently, could have a broad impact in natural product synthesis and preparation of relevant pharmaceutical materials. However, owing to the chemical inertness of alcohols, most methods typically require installation of activating groups for functionalization, making them unattractive from an atom- and step-economical perspective. Nonetheless, many advances have been made. In particular, the Barton-McCombie reaction has become an indispensable tool for reductive functionalization of alcohols. Unfortunately, this transformation requires pre- functionalization of the alcohol substrate, employs highly toxic tin reagents, and invokes the use high reaction temperatures or harmful UV light for initiation of radical intermediates. Furthermore, the overall transformation is limited to H-atom incorporation or reductive coupling with alkenes. Lastly, only a few deoxygenation methods exist that are amenable for late-stage and site-selective deoxygenation in complex systems. Moreover, physical organic chemistry tools available to facilitate the selection of a set of conditions or parameters to afford site-selectivity are limited. In this proposal, we will develop a mild and practical photocatalytic deoxygenation of alcohols. Our strategy will focus on solving the inherent limitation of the Barton McCombie reaction by 1) avoiding the use of toxic tin reagents, 2) obviating the need for pre-functionalization of the alcohol substrate, and 3) allowing for modular coupling of formed alkyl radicals via Ni-catalysis. Specific aim 1 explores the development of a novel photoredox-catalyzed deoxygenation of alcohols. In addition, we outline a general protocol for deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols via inception of the alkyl radical intermediate, formed via β-scission, with various radical electrophiles. Moreover, we highlight an innovative method for the direct cross-coupling of alcohols via metallophotoredox catalysis in both racemic and enantioselective fashion. Specific aim 2 addresses the design strategy for implementing physical chemistry techniques such as Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space. Also, we outline applying this strategy to identify a set of optimal conditions to confer site-selective functionalization in complex polyols. Project Narrative Mild and site-controlled deoxygenation of alcohols could significantly accelerate the late-stage synthesis/diversification of important organic molecules; however, current methods often employ toxic tin reagents, harsh reaction conditions, and require prefunctionalization of the alcohols employed. The strategy proposed would allow for a mild photocatalytic deoxygenation, as well as deoxyfunctionalization, of alcohols that solves the aforementioned limitations of prior art. Moreover, the proposed strategy outlines implementation of physical organic chemistry tools Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space.",Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning,9759306,F32GM129910,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Alkenes', 'Arts', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Employment', 'Intercept', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Organic Synthesis', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phosphines', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Visible Radiation', 'alcohol involvement', 'catalyst', 'design', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'novel', 'polyol', 'predictive tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,-0.04243273255212029
"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,-0.009540163069455546
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,176541,-0.02433338940093427
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,9885663,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Traction', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2019,206139,-0.04128537018224855
"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9767278,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,660597,-0.02178261641575851
"Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a pervasive disease which affects over 30 million individuals worldwide, in whom it is associated with morbidity and mortality, yet for which therapeutic outcomes are suboptimal. One major limitation to mechanistic and clinical advances in AF is its taxonomy, which is based on number of days of detected AF rather than increasingly reported functional and personalized mechanisms. I reasoned that a digital and scalable AF taxonomy, based on interactions of anatomic and functional factors and clinical features, may better guide existing therapy and catalyze future mechanistic and therapeutic advances. I set out to create a predictive tool to guide therapy in AF patients using machine learning of rich mechanistic data from a large multicenter registry of patients undergoing ablation. I hypothesized that clinically actionable AF phenotypes can be defined by statistical clustering between electrophysiologic features, anatomic regions and clinical indices, that can be uncovered by physiological and statistical quantification and machine learning. I have two Specific Aims: 1) To construct a multimodal digital atlas of atrial fibrillation which registers functional indices at absolute and relative spatial locations in both atria from a multicenter registry, and make this atlas available as an open-source software resource. This deliverable will uniquely map the probability that specific mechanisms will be relevant to AF in a specific patient of given clinical characteristics. Novel pathophysiological phenotypes will be defined via probabilistic interactions in these individual components. 2) To develop a predictive tool using machine learning to estimate the likelihood that ablation at any site(s) will contribute to success tailored to individual characteristics, by learning clusters of electrophysiologic features, clinical indices, and anatomic regions in a training population and applying it to a validation cohort from a large multicenter registry. This project uses state-of-the-art computational tools and statistical methods that may reconcile divergent AF mechanistic hypotheses to define novel functional AF phenotypes and guide therapy. In the process, I will be mentored by world leading mentors, in an extraordinary training environment to facilitate this development into an independent physician-scientist in bioengineering-heart rhythm medicine. Project Narrative This research provides an avenue to define atrial fibrillation in an actionable classification rooted in pathophysiologic and mechanistic observations.

"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians. By incorporating artificial intelligence and social networking into a FHx tool, it will lead to greater engagement with FHx collection.

"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations. This project develops informatics standards to facilitate the sharing and reproducibil- ity of these models, enabling a suite of comparative methods to evaluate model transportability.",PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository,9712304,R01EB027650,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomarker discovery', 'case-based', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lung basal segment', 'lung cancer screening', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'software repository', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,657823,-0.018484971514080017
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9673231,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,90185,-0.020974886109651876
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9802783,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2019,488027,-0.024136677499751912
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life.

"Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification The purpose of flow cytometers is to enable the classification of cells or organisms at high throughput. Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity. While our technique should be advantageous for any label-free flow cytometry application requiring high throughput, we will test it here by demonstrating high-throughput classification of microbial communities.

"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care. Project Narrative Systematic reviews are essential for determining which treatments and interventions are safe and effective.

"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication,9656981,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,431185,-0.03642324413483748
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",9871053,K01LM013257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Management', 'Information Systems', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care outcomes', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized physician order entry', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health care delivery', 'health care service organization', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'long short term memory', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilayer perceptron', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized decision', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research facility', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'success', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2019,184191,-0.027021013134434457
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Detecting Middle Ear Fluid Using Smartphones PROJECT SUMMARY Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries; many of its complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. We propose an accessible and accurate smartphone-based screening tool that (i) sends a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detects reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employs a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status in realtime. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and the inaccuracy of visual otoscopy, the system we propose has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home. PROJECT NARRATIVE Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries affecting over 1.23 billion people in 2013 and can lead to complications such as hearing loss, developmental delay, meningitis, mastoiditis, and death. Many of these complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. However, the absence of an accurate and accessible method to detect middle ear fluid has led to high misdiagnosis rates. The consequence is associated hearing and speech impairment rates greater than any other pediatric condition and growing microbial resistance as a result of antibiotic over-prescription. Currently, the technique of choice for detecting middle ear fluid by primary care providers is visual otoscopy, which has a diagnostic accuracy as low as 51%. Although more accurate methods like tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy exist, they require significant expertise and referral to a specialist. Commercial acoustic reflectometers and smartphone-mounted otoscopes require specialized hardware. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need for an accurate, rapid and easily accessible method for resource-limited healthcare providers and caregivers to detect middle ear fluid. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using the speakers and microphones on existing smartphones to detect middle ear fluid by assessing eardrum mobility. Our proposed system would operate by (i) sending a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detecting reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employing a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status. No additional attachments would be required beyond a paper funnel, which acts as a speculum to reduce waveform variability and can be constructed with printer paper, scissors, and tape. This technique is the first software-based screening tool for middle ear fluid detection that uses off-the-shelf smartphones which does not require hardware attachments or visual interpretation. Using data from our existing preliminary clinical study we aim to develop signal processing and machine learning algorithms to optimize sensitivity and specificity. We plan to develop a bench testing technique that enables previously unsupported smartphones to to run our test and prospectively validate our optimized algorithm clinically in parallel testing with an acoustic reflectometer. Further we aim to develop a user interface and improved funnel design. These new designs will undergo usability testing in physician and parent populations.

"Quantifying causality for neuroscience Abstract: Causality is central to neuroscience. For example, we might ask about the causal effect of a neuron on another neuron, or its influence on perception, action, or cognition. Moreover, any medical approaches aim at producing a causal effect – effecting improvements for patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to establish causality, but they are not always practical. For example, while we can electrically or optogenetically activate entire areas, large-scale targeted stimulation of individual neurons is hard. Other ways of establishing causality are problematic: if we observe a correlation it is hard to know its cause. The problem is confounding: there are variables that we do not record that affect the variables we do. This also renders model comparisons problematic – a causally wrong model with few parameters may well fit the observed data better than a causally correct one with many parameters. We thus need data analysis tools that allow authoritatively asking causal questions without the need for random perturbation experiments.  Just like neuroscience now, the field of econometrics once focused on correlations. But since the 1980s, empirical economics has undergone a so-called credibility revolution, requiring the development of rigorous methods to establish causality. Several successful methods have emerged to become the workhorses of empirical economics. The idea underlying these methods is that if one can observe variables that approximate random perturbations, then one can still discover causal relations. This is what economists call a quasi-experiment. We here propose to carry over such quasi-experimental techniques to neuroscience. For example in neuroscience, if there is a random variable that affects only one neuron, then any activity in other neurons correlated with that variable must be causally affected by the neuron. Another famous quasi- experimental method is regression discontinuity design (RDD). This approach effectively uses the noise introduced at the threshold to identify causal relations. Importantly, such techniques have, thanks to decades of research in econometrics, very well understood statistical properties. These approaches promise to considerably enrich the approaches towards causality we have in neuroscience. We have a strong interdisciplinary team, spanning economics, experimental, and computational neuroscience, collaborating on adapting these quasi-experimental techniques to problems in neuroscience through a combination of machine learning and domain-specific engineering. This promises to be a major advance relative to current techniques that generally approach causality in neuroscience through model comparison. Project Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop a set of computational techniques that allow neuroscientists to quantify how neurons causally influence one another. To do so, it utilizes approaches popular in econometrics called quasiexperiments. Such approaches to quantify causality is important as medical perturbations of brains, e.g. treatments of epilepsy or depression are aimed at effecting or causing a change in the brain.",Quantifying causality for neuroscience,9775861,R01EB028162,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'optogenetics', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,803000,-0.03239475071303941
"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",9805011,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,240804,-0.029658834019952098
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines. Beyond toxicological evaluation of therapeutic compounds, our innovative technology will deliver additional benefit to public health by virtue of its utility in investigating the toxicities of environmental chemicals, in line with the focus of government agencies and initiatives such as the EPA and Tox21 in the US and EU-ToxRisk in Europe.",Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding,9761607,R44TR002572,"['Address', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug toxicity', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry Standard', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Nodal', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'cell immortalization', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'environmental chemical', 'expression vector', 'genome editing', 'high throughput screening', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phase I trial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'safety assessment', 'screening', 'site-specific integration', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NCATS,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,821559,-0.025121485834263324
"Technology-supported training and quality assurance for psychosocial interventions Millions of Americans receive psychosocial interventions such as psychotherapy each year for treatment of mental health, behavioral health, and addiction problems. Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services. In research settings, human-based behavioral coding methods are used, but these are time consuming, costly, and rarely used in real-world clinical settings.  Psychotherapy is a “talk based” treatment, and as such, the active ingredients and quality of the therapy are found in the spoken language and interaction of clinician and client. The current proposal will develop a software system (CORE-CBT) that will automatically generate a summary report of quality metrics for CBT, from an audio recording of a CBT session, using speech signal processing and machine learning. Importantly, the current work builds from previous, successful work in developing CORE-MI, an automated system for evaluating motivational interviewing for addiction. The existing CORE-MI tool and the expertise gained through its development will serve as the foundation for the current proposal.  Our technical team is complemented by clinical and implementation expertise via the partnership of the Beck Community Initiative (BCI) with Philadelphia’s DBHIDS. Since 2007, BCI has partnered in training staff at 60 programs in the DBHIDS network to deliver high-quality CBT, including objective quality ratings via the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). Through ongoing training efforts, the BCI has generated an archive of over 6,500 recorded CBT sessions, of which more than 2,300 have been CTRS-coded for quality. This session archive and ongoing real-world trainings in the DBHIDS network provide the perfect context to develop CORE-CBT, a tool that automates quality coding for CBT.  Aim 1: ​Extend and evaluate machine learning algorithms to automatically code CBT competence, using an archive of more than 2,000 CBT fidelity-coded sessions. ​Aim 2: ​Adapt and enhance front-end user interface and session reports with key stakeholders (frontline clinicians, supervisors, and clinic administrators), evaluating acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. ​Aim 3: ​Evaluate CORE-CBT technology during CBT training in 4 BCI partner clinics in the DBHIDS network, with approximately 48-64 frontline clinicians and 4,000 sessions, assessing both implementation outcomes (adoption, sustainment) and service outcomes (increased capacity, efficiency, and effectiveness of training). ​Aim 4:​ Evaluate the appropriateness of CORE-CBT and its metrics for quality assurance (clinics) and value-based reimbursement (payers), using an in-person participatory design workshop. An advisory board of behavioral health payers will provide feedback over the course of the study to maximize generalizability and future uptake in large healthcare systems.

"Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science” annual meetings to be offered each August/September from 2019 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science,9912317,R13AG064968,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Biology of Aging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'graduate student', 'health economics', 'healthspan', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'senescence', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R13,2019,38566,-0.03849103076083192
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation Project Summary/Abstract The past decades have seen a flurry of methods that use extrapolation, smoothing, and other forms of information sharing to compensate for limited and incomplete data. In places without comprehensive vital registration or public health monitoring systems, extrapolation and information sharing techniques are particularly appealing, since there typically is simply not enough data available to produce estimates with sufficient temporal or spatial resolution to influence public health decision making. This proposal reframes uncertainty in extrapolated estimates of vital rates in terms of decision-making. A decision-making framework (i) is grounded in familiar language for policymakers and public health officials, (ii)characterizes consequential and inconsequential model decisions based on variability in outcomes, and (iii) in- corporates both extrapolation and sampling uncertainty. A cornerstone of this project is a novel collaboration with researchers and policymakers at the World Bank. Through this collaboration, we will pilot the proposed decision-making tools and conduct experiments with local and national policymakers in realistic settings. Project Narrative Predictions based on machine learning models are increasingly common inputs into decision making processes across scientific domains. In this proposal I develop and evaluate strategies for making public health decisions based on predicted vital rates, particularly in places without full coverage civil registration. Results from the project will improve strategies for allocating resources for disease surveillance and health monitoring in scarce resource settings.","Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation",9780910,DP2MH122405,"['Big Data', 'Collaborations', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Health', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'World Bank', 'base', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,-0.01575094873964066
"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,-0.03600061183490065
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack Project Summary: Tufts University physics professor Allan Cormack pioneered the field of tomography. His seminal work, from 1963 and 1964, provided both the mathematical foundations of computerized tomography (CT), and tangible proof-of-concept by engineering a rudimentary CT scanner. Taken together, this effort represented the first practical method to ""see into"" an object without physically breaking it open. Along with the engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, he won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these contributions. Since then, tomography has broadened to include a wide range of modalities and problems. This field is unique for the rich interplay among applications in medicine, security, earth sciences, industry, physics, and the mathematics required to solve these problems. This international conference at Tufts, “Modern Challenges in Imaging: In the Footsteps of Allan Cormack” will honor the achievements of Cormack and reflect this diversity in the field by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate the most current research and challenges in the field. This will include work on mathematical models of emerging modalities, tomographic machine learning, dynamic methods, and spectral imaging with applications include medicine and security. The best research from the conference will be disseminated in a special issue of the journal Inverse Problems. Talks will be posted on the conference website. The organizers will recruit a diverse set of experienced participants and trainees, and the conference will be advertised in a range of publications reflecting the scientific and demographic diversity of the field. This conference is unique in that it combines high-level mathematical participants with experts in medical and industrial CT. It is structured to encourage participants from different fields to talk with each other, broaden their horizons, and make connections between problems and methodologies in the various fields. Several of the plenary talks will provide introductions to the areas. Trainees will be integrated into the conference through an informal welcome lunch and a poster session to introduce them to researchers in the field. This supports goals 1, 4, and 5, of the NIBIB: Researchers will present innovative biomedical technologies, engineering solutions, and mathematical methods to better image the body and objects more generally. The synergy between research areas will support the translation of technologies from the academic sphere to medical utility. The training opportunities for graduate students and beginners support the training of the next generation of diverse scientists.

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9742515,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,165554,-0.021569245693737738
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9646811,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2019,130618,-0.016164911172680572
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",9821551,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,146551,-0.011157350375942784
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9765031,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,728162,-0.01357322594240764
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9658873,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,317858,-0.010395903683584876
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9789907,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,366616,-0.0133415855787959
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,9813026,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Venous', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,531144,-0.02439726630536739
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,-0.01937855739944335
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants. All of this work will be pursued with our eMERGE III Network colleagues the goal of improving the quality of the health care we deliver.",Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy,9901995,U01HG008666,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Appendicitis', 'Archives', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base Sequence', 'Boston', 'Budgets', 'CYP3A5 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Costs and Benefits', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Legal Obligations', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Mosaicism', 'Narcotic Addiction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'PTEN gene', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Pyloric Stenosis', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'follow-up', 'gene panel', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'patient oriented', 'pleiotropism', 'preference', 'primary pulmonary hypertension', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2019,742762,-0.04004595252579563
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,9737676,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,804907,-0.007767256966637297
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest.

"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state. Building on New Jersey’s already significant capabilities to promote and facilitate clinical and translational research, NJ ACTS will serve as a catalyst, inspiring new approaches to diagnose and manage disease, and fostering career development of the next generation of translational researchers, and promoting population health.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS,9831333,UL1TR003017,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asian Indian', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Cuban', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease Management', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'Muslim population group', 'New Jersey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Ontology', 'Oral health', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Science', 'Solid', 'South Asian', 'Special Populations Research', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Workforce Development', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohesion', 'community based participatory research', 'disease heterogeneity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'logarithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'trial design']",NCATS,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,UL1,2019,4776211,-0.00941512954458968
"The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers Project Summary  One of the most glaring yet easily addressable gaps in our current scientific workflow and publication system is improving the way that methods are reported, in particular, the lack of key methodological details necessary for interpreting and reproducing a study. Most authors continue to cite the name of the reagent, like an antibody using the vendor, and the city where the vendor is located, but omit the catalog and lot number making antibodies very difficult to track down, thereby reducing reproducibility of the paper. The Resource Identification, RRID, Initiative has successfully implemented a solution to this lack of identification, by asking authors to include a persistent unique identifier (RRID) for each antibody along with a standard syntax that includes the lot information. This syntax is now required in about 100 journals and accepted in at least 400, was accepted into the EQUATOR network of standards and is under consideration by the JATS committee, the NISO standard for journal article metadata. For antibodies, RRIDs are assigned by the AntibodyRegistry.org, which accepts full catalogs from antibody companies and individual antibody records from authors, who are unable to locate the record for the antibody that they used in a study or one which they created in their lab. This process should be made as easy as possible for authors, and through text analysis we have devised a set of tools that should help authors create better records with less work.  The AntibodyRegistry.org was created as part of an academic project and it has successfully incorporated millions of antibody records, thousands of which have now been cited in scientific papers using the RRID syntax. The use of RRID is growing, and in order to support the longer term sustainability of the AntibodyRegistry.org, a core community authority for RRIDs, this resource needs to be enhanced to align with the available commercial and non-commercial funding sources. We propose the addition of features, valuable to antibody companies and journals, to improve market intelligence and reporting around antibodies. We also propose to auto-generate antibody entries for authors and curators when submitting/curating an antibody to decrease the time it takes to complete the task, thereby reducing the barrier to entry and cost. Project Narrative The AntibodyRegistry.org is a catalog of antibodies used in research and serves as the antibody identifier source for the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) initiative. The use of these identifiers improves rigor and transparency in compliance with both journal and NIH standards. As the RRID initiative grows, the AntibodyRegistry.org is becoming an increasingly well-used and valuable resource; requiring increased attention from curation staff. Improvements to the AntibodyRegistry.org are needed to increase commercial value and thereby its sustainability, decrease curation cost, and provide a higher level of service to the scientific community.",The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers,9680073,R41GM131551,"['Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Businesses', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Cities', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'information framework', 'journal article', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,"SCICRUNCH, INC.",R41,2019,149373,-0.01966242476078092
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,-0.021860950073142087
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9792242,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2019,1308373,-0.017868938375790122
"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,9938114,R01HS027363,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,496121,-0.024587580457584725
"PhendoPHL:A Data-Science Enabled Personal Health Library to Manage Endometriosis PROJECT SUMMARY Endometriosis is a chronic condition which is estimated to affect 10% of women in reproductive age. It has a very high burden on quality of life and productivity, and the self-management needs of women living with the disease are multiple. This project aims to design, develop, and evaluate a data-science enabled personal health library called PhendoPHL to support the self-management needs of women living with endometriosis. Grounded in self-determination theory, and informed by user-centered design methods PhendoPHL will enable exploration of health patterns through interactive visualizations of integrated clinical and self-tracked data, identify temporal personalized patterns and comparison to population norms through novel data-science methods, and provide actionable visualizations of data for shared decision making during patient-provider encounters. PhendoPHL builds on our existing work in novel informatics methods for endometriosis, and the extensive experience of our research team in designing and evaluating novel informatics interventions. The proposed work also fills a research gap in personal health informatics: the development and validation of novel computational methods to identify personalized and population- based patterns in clinical and self-monitoring data; both types of data which are critical to successful self- management and challenging from a computational standpoint because they are temporal, heterogeneous, and sparse. Using a mixed-methods evaluation study (standardized surveys, logfile analysis, Critical Incident Technique interviews, focus groups), we will study PhendoPHL’s usability, assess the factors critical to user engagement and perceived impact on self-determination and shared decision making, and the generalizability to other reproductive chronic conditions in women’s health.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9781491,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'learning strategy', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'research data dissemination', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2019,747700,-0.012632014523104472
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9732337,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318886,-0.011327686139192583
"AUGS/DUKE UrogynCREST program PROJECT SUMMARY Health Services Research (HSR) and predictive analytics are rapidly growing fields and will have enormous implications for women’s health research in pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). The AUGS/DUKE Urogynecology Clinical Research Educational Scientist Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care. It brings together expertise in health service and women’s health research, medical informatics and prediction modeling. This program will target Urogynecology Faculty at the Assistant Professor level who seek successful careers in health services research (HSR) and analytics. Participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and interactive coursework; hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis; and project-based one on one mentoring. The UrogynCREST program will be an interactive, hands-on educational program with centralized activities organized and delivered by distance through a popular on-line learning platform called Sakai, with educational software designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. A diverse faculty with expertise in data sciences teaches courses and the advanced methodology required to perform HSR. Yearly in-person meetings at the annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting enhance networking and the development of partnerships between participants from various institutions, as well as, interactions with the mentors and other HSR in the field. The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs).

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9676860,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2019,7168390,-0.014360213374074888
"Augmented Reality Platform for Feedback and Assessment in STEM elementary education ABSTRACT This SBIR Phase I project will build evidence-based content, challenges and assessments that promote: simulation-based learning; troubleshooting and critical-thinking; and diversity and inclusion in STEM learning. The approach will be transferable by design to teaching and measuring learner performance across scientific disciplines. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is already transforming science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future. These technologies have promise in delivering simulation environments capable of nurturing deep learning and higher-level thinking in K-12 students through practical experience, hand-on exercises and real-life applications, such as troubleshooting. Digital AR and VR educational content is beginning to address and develop these skills, but a platform has yet to be developed to effectively enable broad adoption in elementary settings. Cost efficient methods to provide formative feedback and gather summative evaluations for Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is also an unmet need. The successful completion of the proposed project will provide an evidence-centered content delivery and assessment framework as well as tool for addressing NGSS performance expectations that is transferable across topic areas and readily scalable for large-scale national implementation. The content will intentionally incorporate aspects of context and diversity of characters to ensure inclusion of groups that are historically underrepresented – specifically females and ethnic minorities. NARRATIVE Success in the workforce of the future will require the high-level thinking skills that the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is transforming science and engineering education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future, through practical simulation-based experiences, but these lack the capability for performance assessment crucial to teachers and decision makers.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,9785367,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola virus', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2019,247413,-0.01677572876701653
"VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. A healthy dietary pattern is paramount in disease risk reduction. Since 2010, the dietary pattern approach has been recommended to examine the relation of the totality of diet and health outcomes by U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees; meanwhile longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. Yet, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing longitudinal diet-quality variations and even rudimentary for validating diet- quality patterns that describe these dynamic variations, therefore, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health/disease relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field. We propose to develop an innovative statistical learning tool for diet-quality trajectory pattern-recognition based on rich and highly-comparable longitudinal dietary datasets from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OS) pertaining to a variety of individuals, race/ethnicities, and geographical locations, and spanning up to 30 years, collected across 4 NIH- funded RCTs in Massachusetts, and 2 large-scale multi-site national RCT and OS studies as well as simulated dietary data based on these trials. Our project builds on PI Fang’s NIH-funded behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition tool (Multiple-Imputation based Fuzzy Clustering, MIFuzzy) which processes longitudinal trial data with missing and zero-inflated values, and identifies latent trajectory patterns that characterize patients’ complex engagement and cognitive response variations during multi-component RCTs and better explains the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This project will enhance and expand MIFuzzy to a Visual- Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition tool (VIP), adapted to diet-quality trajectory pattern analyses and chronic disease risk assessment. Our goal is to provide a new multi-view of diet-quality trajectory patterns and associated outcomes from longitudinal studies. Based upon high-quality and comparable RCT and OS longitudinal dietary data from NIDDK-, NHLBI-, and NIMH-funded studies, this VIP project will help grow more valid evidence for developing dietary guidelines and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of patient/individual types, potentially enabling better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Developing this evidence-based VIP tool will also contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern- recognition methods, help scientific communities and the lay public compare with local and national diet-quality guidelines, and assess dietary health risks. In the long run, this VIP project will contribute to creating a data management platform that support near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Evaluating diet quality and encouraging healthful dietary change is paramount for preventing, or managing, many chronic conditions and diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our innovative Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern-recognition (VIP) method will identify clusters of distinct diet-quality patterns in multiple longitudinal dietary datasets from local and national NIH-funded randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This work will help formulate stronger evidence for national dietary guidelines, deepen our understanding of diet quality trajectory patterns, and elucidate relationships between these patterns and chronic diseases for a range of patient/individual types; it can potentially enable personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Open-access dissemination of our diet quality pattern recognition tool will contribute to the infrastructure of dietary-intervention studies, advance pattern recognition methodology, and help the scientific community and the public to compare individual dietary behaviors with local and national diet-quality patterns and associated health risks.",VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials,9907572,R56DK114514,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Reduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'good diet', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R56,2019,452178,-0.020478095841983176
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9689119,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2019,423432,-0.023366189128088084
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,-0.026467714524971722
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks ABSTRACT Electronic health record (EHR) databases collect data that reflect routine clinical care. These databases are increasingly used in comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, quality improvement assessment, and public health surveillance to generate actionable evidence that improves patient care. It is often necessary to analyze multiple databases that cover large and diverse populations to improve the statistical power of the study or generalizability of the findings. A common approach to analyzing multiple databases is the use of a distributed research network (DRN) architecture, in which data remains under the physical control of data partners. Although EHRs are generally thought to contain rich clinical information, the information is not uniformly collected. Certain information is available only for some patients, and only at some time points for a given patient. There are generally two types of missing information in EHRs. The first is the conventionally understood and obvious missing data in which some data fields (e.g., body mass index) are not complete for various reasons, e.g., the clinician does not collect the information or the patient chooses not to provide the information. The second is less obvious because the data field is not empty but the recorded value may be incorrect due to missing data. For example, EHRs generally do not have complete data for care that occurs in a different delivery system. A medical condition (e.g., asthma) may be coded as “no” but the true value would have been “yes” if more complete data had been available, e.g., from claims data as the other delivery system would submit a claim to the patient’s health plan for the care provided. In other words, one may incorrectly treat “absence of evidence” as “evidence of absence”. EHRs hold great promise but we must address several outstanding methodological challenges inherent in the databases, specifically missing data. Addressing missing data is more challenging in DRNs due to different missing data mechanisms across databases. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Apply and assess missing data methods developed in single-database settings to handle obvious and well-recognized missing data in DRNs; (2) Apply and assess machine learning and predictive modeling techniques to address less obvious and under-recognized missing data for select variables in DRNs; and (3) Apply and assess a comprehensive analytic approach that combines conventional missing data methods and machine learning techniques to address missing data in DRNs. The analytic methods developed in this project, including the extension of existing missing data methods to DRNs, the innovative use of machine learning techniques to address missing data, and their integration with privacy- protecting analytic methods, will have direct impact on the design and analysis of future comparative effectiveness and safety studies, and patient-centered outcomes research conducted in DRNs.

"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,-0.02225390911486465
"ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032) Project Summary/Abstract Technology has the potential to accelerate clinical research and reduce the burden of participation in rare diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an x-linked genetic disorder that results in progressive muscle weakness with loss of ambulation by 10-12 years of age, progression of arm weakness resulting in difficulty with self-feeding and other self-care activities in adolescence, and death resulting from cardiopulmonary insufficiency by age 30 years. Studies in rare diseases are inherently difficult due to a small recruitment pool and a limited number of sites that possess the experience and resources to participate as a study site. An outcome measure that quantifies change in both ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with minimal evaluator training could enable more efficient data collection in multi-site clinical trials. Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), has the potential to meet this need. ACTIVE is a 65-second game utilizing a skeletal-tracking algorithm to quantify workspace volume (WSV) elicited through maximal arm reaching overhead, side-to-side, and forward while also encouraging trunk lean in each direction. Our studies have shown that ACTIVE is valid and reliable in quantifying WSV in persons with DMD across the span of age and abilities. However, to increase access and portability of a tool for use across trial sites, it is critical that tool has sound scientific and technological construction. ACTIVE WSV was originally built upon the Microsoft Kinect and Kinect One for Xbox platforms. The skeletal tracking algorithm developed by Microsoft vastly exceeds all other programs as it had the full backing of the Microsoft machine. Unfortunately, the Kinect, in its additional sense, has been abandoned for more current artificial intelligence applications. The Microsoft Kinect Azure will soon be released with higher resolution and programming capabilities. Our full DDT submission has been delayed as each new camera release has required reprogramming of our software to ensure valid and reliable results. Our team has recently expanded to include software development partners, The Plan Works (thePlan), who have the technological expertise to alter our current codebase to ensure transfer of ACTIVE across camera sensor platforms is more efficient and reliable as we expect ongoing technological advances to provide opportunities for continued advances. To this end, our current application seeks support to verify the technology of the ACTIVE WSV system to 1) confirm the use of unique code that can be ported across platforms over time and 2) improving the ease of use and limit training needed at a growing number of inexperienced centers. Project Narrative Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), is a 65-second outcome assessment that quantifies a person’s workspace volume and has the potential to expand the enrollment pool by measuring both ambulant and non-ambulant subjects. While the scientific construction of the tool is sound, ongoing technological advances and changes have made it challenging to port our software across camera platforms. Our proposal seeks funding to support final software updates to ensure changes in technology components (i.e. camera sensor systems) or coding instability will not interfere with clinical trial data collection and allow us to complete our final submission package.",ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032),9989528,U01FD006883,[' '],FDA,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,U01,2019,215170,-0.02860067110078966
"Epi25 Clinical Phenotyping R03 PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical genetic data suggests that specific categories of epilepsy have genetic contributors, and there may be some overlap between categories. The Epi25 Collaborative was formed among more than 40 cohorts from around the world to sequence as many as 25,000 genomes or exomes. As of 2017, the collaborative has sequenced more than 13,000 exomes and clinical data has been collected for more than 8,000 cases. This project will complete the collection and review of the clinical data for each sample in the Epi25 collection to facilitate the translation of genomic and clinical discoveries into improved care for patients.

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",9938200,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,497273,-0.019098484902051995
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases.

"The Enzymatic Reader Project Summary At this point in time, it is generally understood and agreed upon that single-molecule sequencing (SMS) is the future of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and epitranscriptomics due to its significant advantages over other technologies and methods. However, in order for these advantages to be fully realized, and for SMS to become the “gold standard” sequencing approach, significant issues and hurdles must be solved and overcome. During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) aims to demonstrate a completely new and enabling SMS method that will possess the ability to directly and correctly identify individual nucleotides, including chemically modified nucleotides. During this project, we will both demonstrate the ability of this entirely new sequencing approach to sequence DNA with high accuracy (directly comparing the obtained accuracy, throughput, error mechanisms and associated rates to other SMS approaches) and correctly identify (and sequence) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its derivatives, at the single molecule level. At the conclusion of this Phase I project, we will have successfully demonstrated an entirely new and dramatically improved SMS approach, and reduced the associated risks involved with its full future commercial developments. There is a current need within the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) or so called third generation sequencing (TGS) for new, enabling instrumentation that is capable of high-accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats. The entirely new SMS methodology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitations of currently available NGS, TGS, and SMS technologies, resulting in technology that is cost-efficient, highly accurate, easy to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and yields highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing. Through significant advancements made during this program, this resulting technology will revolutionize the use of the genome and epigenome, radically change standard R&D and clinical practices, and greatly advance clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making. Project Narrative The novel single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technology developed during this project will enable high- accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats via a cost-efficient and easy-to-use methodology. The impact of these advances in SMS will eventually enable wide-scale, routine clinical care and diagnostics toward advanced precision medicine, not just R&D.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times.

"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,-0.014185567257040411
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9691090,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,308553,-0.02946598372864985
"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMap™, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. Project Narrative This multi-phase Fast Track SBIR project will develop and validate a new laboratory developed test to differentiate malignant melanocytic tumors from benign nevi and complete development of an imaging mass spectrometry-based diagnostic service platform for a clinical laboratory. The clinical assay developed under this proposal augments current practice by providing molecular measurements that are used as objective criteria in the diagnosis of melanoma. Successful completion of this Fast Track project will result in a fully documented and validated assay ready for launch as a laboratory developed test.",A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions,9905050,R44CA228897,"['Amendment', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Digestion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melanocytic Neoplasm', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Microtomy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nevus', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical shape', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States', 'Validation', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cloud software', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'histopathological examination', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality risk', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'skin lesion', 'tissue preparation', 'web interface']",NCI,"FRONTIER DIAGNOSTICS, LLC",R44,2019,998671,-0.01358064705429498
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9522037,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,536041,-0.02586680929544428
"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication,9503469,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,505649,-0.03642324413483748
"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, “HindSight”, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating clinicians’ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSight’s predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (≥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labeler’s performance. Labeling AUROC ≥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1’s labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior. We will develop software that examines discharged patients’ electronic health records (EHR), identifies clinicians’ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and passes these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction.",Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection,9557659,R43TR002309,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pythons', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,324971,-0.03088741311971341
"Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, and represents a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. Progress in improving diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has been hindered by its heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Such heterogeneity makes the underlying neurobiology difficult to characterize, and has led to efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups. These efforts date back to the dawn of the modern psychopharmacologic era - initially focused on atypical and melancholic depression, and more recently on subtypes such as anxious and irritable depression.  Subtyping efforts are complicated by a paucity of large clinical cohorts with similar ascertainment and phenotyping. In particular, the available data often focuses on a very narrow range of depressive symptoms, along with a restricted set of comorbidities, and typically encompasses only the acute phase of treatment. As a result, despite intriguing findings in one or occasionally two cohorts, subtyping has not been widely deployed in clinical practice, nor used to meaningfully improve translational investigation.  The utility of electronic health records and registries to create in silico cohort studies has been demonstrated in numerous settings, including psychiatry. Beyond sample size and efficiency of ascertainment, these data types often have advantages in the range of non-depressive phenotypes captured and availability of longitudinal data.  The present study therefore proposes to create a very large cohort of individuals with MDD, defined by a validated algorithm, spanning two health systems, and to apply novel machine learning methods to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will be validated by comparison with standard phenotypic definitions, annotation by trained raters using a standard 'intruder' paradigm, and correlation with medication prescribing Then, as proof of concept the biological basis of these subtypes will be characterized by examining heritability and polygenic risk using a large genetic biobank. Beyond determining convergent validity, this last step will provide proof-of-concept for broader application of data-driven subtypes for translational investigation in biobanks and registries.  The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotypic and genomic study as well as application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in machine learning. It will lay the groundwork for further validation and application of data-driven disease subtyping across medicine.

"Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient diversity Abstract  Significance:  In  this  SBIR  project,  we  propose  to  predict  and  detect  pediatric  severe  sepsis  by  developing  a  machine-­learning-­based  clinical  decision  support  system  for  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  pediatric  sepsis  screening. The pediatric population is underserved, with fundamental research and understanding of pediatric  sepsis  syndromes  lagging  behind  that  of  the  adult  population.  The  proposed  work  will  develop  machine  learning sepsis predictions on the highly heterogeneous pediatric population, by combining multi-­task learning  methods with expert clinical knowledge of how pediatric sepsis presentation is dependent on age and on pre-­ existing  conditions.  The  multi-­task  learning  approach  will  use  age  or  comorbidities  to  define  “tasks,”  each  one  associated  with  prediction  on  a  particular  subpopulation,  and  then  link  the  learning  process  together  between  tasks. Research Questions: Which methods of using these task-­defining parameters are most effective? How  can  we  most  effectively  learn  the  degree  of  similarity  between  pediatric  subpopulations  and  leverage  this  to  improve classification performance? Prior Work: InSight was originally developed to predict sepsis and septic  shock from adult EHR data. After retraining on pediatric cases, in preliminary experiments with a retrospective  set  of  pediatric  (2-­17  yr)  inpatient  encounters  (n  =  11,127;;  103  [0.9%]  severely  septic),  at  the  University  of  California  San  Francisco  (UCSF),  InSight  achieved  an  AUROC  0.912  and  0.727  for  the  detection  and  4-­hour  pre-­onset  prediction  of  sepsis.  This  performance  can  be  improved  for  better  pediatric  sepsis  prediction.  Specific  Aims:  To  empirically  evaluate  different  learning  schemes  using  age  with  and  without  multi-­task  methods,  within  the  UCSF  pediatric  severe  sepsis  data  set  (Aim  1).  To  exploit  an  expert-­proposed  network  graph  structure  for  comorbidity-­described  pediatric  subpopulations  that  provides  superior  predictive  performance  over  naïve  methods  and  graphs,  both  for  the  overall  population  and  for  underserved  subpopulations  (Aim  2).  Methods:  We  propose  to  use  multi-­task  methods  that  penalize  deviations  between  classifiers  on  neighboring  tasks  and  that  iteratively  learn  the  strength  of  these  links.  These  methods  will  be  compared with total task independence, or passing age into classifier training as an ordinary input. Criteria for  Success:  Success  will  be  shown  by  4-­hour  pre-­onset  AUROC  gains  of  0.02  (overall  population)  and  0.03  for  the previously weakest of three age subpopulations (2-­5, 6-­12, and 13-­17 yrs;; 4-­hour pre-­onset prediction, p <  0.05, McNemar’s test, 4-­fold cross-­validation). The best structure for mapping similarities between comorbidity  tasks will improve the overall AUROC by 0.03 (p < 0.05) and by 0.07 for ≥ 2 comorbidity subpopulations of ≥ 100 patients (p < 0.05). Outcome: These improvements will enable InSight to deliver strong sepsis predictive  performance across the widely heterogeneous pediatric population.         Narrative  Pediatric  sepsis  can  be  difficult  to  diagnose,  in  part  because the  pediatric  population  is  highly  heterogeneous;;  clinical  decision  support  (CDS)  systems  have  the  potential  to  aid  in  the  diagnosis  and  prediction  of  pediatric  sepsis, if the underlying diversity of the pediatric population is correctly addressed. We will develop a machine-­ learning-­based  sepsis  CDS  system  by  using  multi-­task  learning  techniques  to  define  a  set  of  “tasks,”  each  corresponding  to  predicting  severe  sepsis  in  a  clinically  distinct  subpopulation  of  pediatric  inpatients,  together  with  a  set  of  inter-­task  connections  that  share  information  between  similar  subpopulations.    This  will  enable  improved sepsis prediction across the widely heterogeneous and underserved pediatric patient population.     ",Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9504168,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2018,90050,-0.020974886109651876
"Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a pervasive disease which affects over 30 million individuals worldwide, in whom it is associated with morbidity and mortality, yet for which therapeutic outcomes are suboptimal. One major limitation to mechanistic and clinical advances in AF is its taxonomy, which is based on number of days of detected AF rather than increasingly reported functional and personalized mechanisms. I reasoned that a digital and scalable AF taxonomy, based on interactions of anatomic and functional factors and clinical features, may better guide existing therapy and catalyze future mechanistic and therapeutic advances. I set out to create a predictive tool to guide therapy in AF patients using machine learning of rich mechanistic data from a large multicenter registry of patients undergoing ablation. I hypothesized that clinically actionable AF phenotypes can be defined by statistical clustering between electrophysiologic features, anatomic regions and clinical indices, that can be uncovered by physiological and statistical quantification and machine learning. I have two Specific Aims: 1) To construct a multimodal digital atlas of atrial fibrillation which registers functional indices at absolute and relative spatial locations in both atria from a multicenter registry, and make this atlas available as an open-source software resource. This deliverable will uniquely map the probability that specific mechanisms will be relevant to AF in a specific patient of given clinical characteristics. Novel pathophysiological phenotypes will be defined via probabilistic interactions in these individual components. 2) To develop a predictive tool using machine learning to estimate the likelihood that ablation at any site(s) will contribute to success tailored to individual characteristics, by learning clusters of electrophysiologic features, clinical indices, and anatomic regions in a training population and applying it to a validation cohort from a large multicenter registry. This project uses state-of-the-art computational tools and statistical methods that may reconcile divergent AF mechanistic hypotheses to define novel functional AF phenotypes and guide therapy. In the process, I will be mentored by world leading mentors, in an extraordinary training environment to facilitate this development into an independent physician-scientist in bioengineering-heart rhythm medicine. Project Narrative This research provides an avenue to define atrial fibrillation in an actionable classification rooted in pathophysiologic and mechanistic observations. Such a classification scheme would further our understanding and refine our conversation about complex arrhythmia in cardiac tissue. Only an understanding at this level is will provide truly effective and safe treatments of each individual patient’s arrhythmic condition.","Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications",9611012,F32HL144101,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Atrium', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy trial', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'predictive tools', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'trial design']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,63034,-0.024564349119793584
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care.

"Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification The purpose of flow cytometers is to enable the classification of cells or organisms at high throughput. Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity. While our technique should be advantageous for any label-free flow cytometry application requiring high throughput, we will test it here by demonstrating high-throughput classification of microbial communities. NARRATIVE Our goal is to improve the information extraction capacity of label-free flow cytometers, while maintaining high throughput capacity.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

The goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical modeling frameworks for making forecasts of infectious diseases in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches,9553816,R35GM119582,"['Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modernization', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'vector control']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2018,368020,-0.0035616789373628475
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"A computational approach to early sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the performance of InSight, a machine-learning- based sepsis screening system, in situations of limited training data from the target clinical site. The proposed work will make possible prospective clinical deployments to sites which are smaller or lack clinical data repositories, by significantly reducing the amount of training data necessary down to a few weeks of clinical observation. Classically, a machine-learning-based system like InSight requires complete retraining for each new clinical setting, in turn requiring a new and large collection of data from each target deployment site. We will circumvent this requirement via transfer learning techniques, which transfer knowledge acquired previously in a source clinical setting to a new, target setting. Research Questions: Which transfer learning methods and paired classification algorithms are most suitable for use with InSight, requiring minimal target-site training data while maintaining strong performance? Are these methods and algorithms robust across the several common sepsis-spectrum definitions? Prior Work: We have developed InSight using the MIMIC-III retrospective data set, on which it attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. We have also conducted pilot transfer learning  ≥ experiments in a different clinical task, mortality forecasting, in which transfer learning yields a 10-fold reduction in the amount of target-site training data required to achieve AUROC 0.80. Specific Aims: Aim 1 - to implement and assess side-by-side four diverse transfer learning methods for a retrospective clinical sepsis prediction task, where the source data set is MIMIC-III and the simulated clinical target is a data set drawn from UCSF. Aim 2 - to determine which among the best methods from Aim 1 also provide robust performance when applied to two additional sepsis-spectrum gold standards. Methods: We will prepare implementations of transfer learning methods which use instance transfer, residual learning and/or feature augmentation, kernel length scale transfer, and feature transfer. We will test these methods with applicable classifiers on subsets of the UCSF set, using cross-validation and quantifying discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The best method/classifier pairs will require no more than 30 examples of septic patients from the target set and attain AUROC superiorities of 0.05 in 0- and 4-hour pre-onset sepsis prediction/detection, relative to the best tested alternative screening systems (Aim 1). The top three pairs will then be tested for robustness to gold standard choice, using septic shock (0- and 4-hour) and SIRS-based sepsis (0-hour) gold standards; in these tests, at least one pair must again attain 0.05 margin of superiority in AUROC versus the alternative screening systems (Aim 2). Future Directions: The results of these experiments will enable InSight to be robustly deployed to diverse clinical sites, yielding high performance without the need for extensive target-site data acquisition. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing relevant information. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but accessing its full strength requires re-training with retrospective data from each target clinical site. We will use transfer learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of target-site training data required by InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for sepsis prediction, and empirically evaluate several such methods on a patient data set, using three different sepsis-related gold standards.",A computational approach to early sepsis detection,9557664,R43TR002221,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'prospective', 'screening', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,310782,-0.0008296711535768639
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9535479,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'real time monitoring', 'standard of care', 'success', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,181755,-0.023227659588891836
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9557573,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,242266,-0.006796081804340279
"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Companions', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Spinach - dietary', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'aptamer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'targeted biomarker']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,224925,-0.05893611554411714
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines. Beyond toxicological evaluation of therapeutic compounds, our innovative technology will deliver additional benefit to public health by virtue of its utility in investigating the toxicities of environmental chemicals, in line with the focus of government agencies and initiatives such as the EPA and Tox21 in the US and EU-ToxRisk in Europe.",Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding,9623156,R44TR002572,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug toxicity', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry Standard', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Nodal', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'cell immortalization', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'environmental chemical', 'expression vector', 'genome editing', 'high throughput screening', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phase I trial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'site-specific integration', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NCATS,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,1178386,-0.025121485834263324
"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9598902,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,166645,-0.021569245693737738
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9639469,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,407175,-0.0133415855787959
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9535858,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,728162,-0.01357322594240764
"An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking Project Summary/Abstract  Particle tracking (PT) is a biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena of diverse species, and rheological properties of complex materials. PT experiments involve first obtaining high resolution videos that capture time-resolved increments of particles, followed by extraction of traces of entities of interest from videos in the form of spatial locations over time, a process we refer to as path conversion. Finally, quantitative analysis of the traces will yield diffusivities, viscoelasticity, etc.  Lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, are characterized by a highly viscoelastic mucus layer that is incapable of being cleared by mucociliary clearance. Not surprisingly, the viscoelasticity of mucus often directly reflects disease progression. A variety of mucolytics are being investigated, but due to the variable composition and properties of mucus between patients, effective mucolytics treatment will likely be different between individuals; too little/inappropriate mucolytics will not be effective in restoring mucus clearance, whereas too much may result in bronchorrhea. Although microbeads-based rheology has been performed on a variety of mucus specimens in basic research, the capacity for high throughput characterization of rheological properties of biological specimens in a clinical setting is currently not available. This limitation can be attributed to inefficiencies of path conversion: current PT software requires extensive human supervision/intervention to achieve accurate path conversion, not only resulting in poor reproducibility and throughput but also restricting its use to only expert labs. Our vision is to make PT as objective and easy to use as a simple plate reader that can be readily utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening), and research professionals. Towards this goal, we have created a neural network tracker (NNT) that automatically determines the location of all particles in each frame with zero user-input (i.e. no parameter for users to change), and retains the identity of all particles from frame to frame. The innovation is that NNT can robustly, reproducibly, and accurately track a wide range of 2D/3D videos with virtually no need for human intervention, achieving unparalleled time savings. We have already successfully deployed NNT over the Google cloud, which offers exceptional scalability. Nevertheless, for time-sensitive applications, such as an automated PT rheometer, the transfer of large video data files is likely prohibitive. Therefore, in this Phase I STTR, we seek to enable real-time NNT-based PT analysis on the local machine while video microscopy data is being acquired by the microscope, and allow data from PT analysis to drive the operation of the microscope. In Aim 1, we will integrate our NNT with a single objective fluorescence microscope system called Monoptes. Aim 2 will evaluate the performance of our NNT- Monoptes system. If successful, our technology would form the basis of a fully automated PT system capable of measuring rheological properties of fluids/materials or distribution of particle sizes in a 96-well plate format. Project Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately, its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a software that can consistently provide superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. In this proposal, we will integrate this latest advance with sophisticated instrumentation to develop a microscope system capable of fully automated particle tracking microscopy in a 96-well plate format. If successful, the instrument will likely be utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening of patients), and research professionals.",An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking,9620574,R41GM130202,"['Acceleration', 'Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Screening', 'Effectiveness', 'Elasticity', 'Engineering', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'HIV Infections', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microspheres', 'Motion', 'Mucociliary Clearance', 'Mucolytics', 'Mucous body substance', 'Output', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Series', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Spottings', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Video Microscopy', 'Viscosity', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical tools', 'cloud based', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'movie', 'novel', 'operation', 'particle', 'patient screening', 'physical science', 'pre-clinical', 'submicron', 'virtual', 'viscoelasticity']",NIGMS,"AI TRACKING SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2018,224894,-0.02020104880507311
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants.

These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development.

"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9568310,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2018,1308227,-0.017868938375790122
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9503015,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2018,664486,-0.017404938162124493
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data.

"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9594103,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'learning strategy', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'research data dissemination', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2018,793267,-0.012632014523104472

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9537633,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2018,489952,-0.01824249198502779
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9547897,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,317404,-0.011327686139192583
"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9521586,R01LM012095,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobin', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer human interaction', 'data access', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'stem', 'trend', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,452158,-0.017433868677844723

"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMapTM, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. Project Narrative This multi-phase Fast Track SBIR project will develop and validate a new laboratory developed test to differentiate malignant melanocytic tumors from benign nevi and complete development of an imaging mass spectrometry-based diagnostic service platform for a clinical laboratory. The clinical assay developed under this proposal augments current practice by providing molecular measurements that are used as objective criteria in the diagnosis of melanoma. Successful completion of this Fast Track project will result in a fully documented and validated assay ready for launch as a laboratory developed test.",A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions,9557356,R44CA228897,"['Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Digestion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melanocytic Neoplasm', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Microtomy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nevus', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical shape', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States', 'Validation', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cloud software', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'histopathological examination', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular imaging', 'operation', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'skin lesion', 'tissue preparation', 'web interface']",NCI,"FRONTIER DIAGNOSTICS, LLC",R44,2018,299244,-0.01358064705429498
"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference.

"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce. This year’s symposium will focus issues related to return of genomic results in both clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations.",Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)?,9612854,R13HG010286,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acceleration', 'African American', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuing Education', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'frontier', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health information technology', 'incentive program', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'multiple omics', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'senior faculty', 'symposium', 'trend']",NHGRI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R13,2018,10000,-0.011622177371080872
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9479717,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2018,423431,-0.023366189128088084
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9423915,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,325845,-0.02946598372864985
"Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks ABSTRACT Electronic health record (EHR) databases collect data that reflect routine clinical care. These databases are increasingly used in comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, quality improvement assessment, and public health surveillance to generate actionable evidence that improves patient care. It is often necessary to analyze multiple databases that cover large and diverse populations to improve the statistical power of the study or generalizability of the findings. A common approach to analyzing multiple databases is the use of a distributed research network (DRN) architecture, in which data remains under the physical control of data partners. Although EHRs are generally thought to contain rich clinical information, the information is not uniformly collected. Certain information is available only for some patients, and only at some time points for a given patient. There are generally two types of missing information in EHRs. The first is the conventionally understood and obvious missing data in which some data fields (e.g., body mass index) are not complete for various reasons, e.g., the clinician does not collect the information or the patient chooses not to provide the information. The second is less obvious because the data field is not empty but the recorded value may be incorrect due to missing data. For example, EHRs generally do not have complete data for care that occurs in a different delivery system. A medical condition (e.g., asthma) may be coded as “no” but the true value would have been “yes” if more complete data had been available, e.g., from claims data as the other delivery system would submit a claim to the patient’s health plan for the care provided. In other words, one may incorrectly treat “absence of evidence” as “evidence of absence”. EHRs hold great promise but we must address several outstanding methodological challenges inherent in the databases, specifically missing data. Addressing missing data is more challenging in DRNs due to different missing data mechanisms across databases. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Apply and assess missing data methods developed in single-database settings to handle obvious and well-recognized missing data in DRNs; (2) Apply and assess machine learning and predictive modeling techniques to address less obvious and under-recognized missing data for select variables in DRNs; and (3) Apply and assess a comprehensive analytic approach that combines conventional missing data methods and machine learning techniques to address missing data in DRNs. The analytic methods developed in this project, including the extension of existing missing data methods to DRNs, the innovative use of machine learning techniques to address missing data, and their integration with privacy- protecting analytic methods, will have direct impact on the design and analysis of future comparative effectiveness and safety studies, and patient-centered outcomes research conducted in DRNs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will refine existing methods and develop new methods to address missing data issues in electronic health record databases.",Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks,9575484,R01HS026214,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2018,400000,-0.028579891312690304
"Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions Project Summary Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize and critically assess bodies of evidence to produce a comprehensive unbiased assessment of what is known. As such, SRs are vital for evidence-based decision-making. However, given the pace of new research, the process of developing an SR remains too slow. One particularly time-consuming step in the process is citation screening, which requires manual review of thousands of abstracts to identify only a small number of relevant studies. Screening such large numbers of studies is necessary because systematic reviewers place a high priority on identifying all relevant studies to avoid bias. Innovative citation screening tools, which utilize text-mining and new sophisticated machine learning methods, represent one potential solution. Abstrackr (Brown University) and EPPI-Reviewer (University College London) are off- the-shelf, web-based citation screening tools designed to improve screening efficiency. Both programs utilize machine- learning techniques to semi-automate the screening process by modeling the probability that each citation will meet criteria for inclusion. This allows efficiency gains through screening prioritization and screening truncation. With screening prioritization, citations are organized for screening from highest to lowest likelihood of inclusion. This allows earlier retrieval of full-text articles and facilitates workflow planning. Organizing citations by likelihood of inclusion also allows reviewers the option of truncating the screening process when remaining citations fall below a certain threshold. While promising, existing studies have predominantly been performed by computer scientists testing individual tools or comparing different modeling algorithms (e.g., various classifiers). To date, no studies have performed a direct comparison of citation screening tools. Similarly, although automatically excluding citations that fall below particular thresholds could substantively improve efficiency, adoption has been low due to concerns that relevant studies could be missed. However, how often studies would be missed and how important such omissions would be remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will (1) Compare screening efficiency for two citation-screening tools, Abstrackr and EPPI-reviewer, and (2) Characterize the potential impact of using thresholds to exclude low probability studies automatically. To address aim 1, using citations from 3 large and 6 small completed evidence reports, we will compare Abstrackr to EPPI-Reviewer for citation screening. Using screening prioritization, we will assess what proportion of articles must be screened to identify all included studies (e.g., to achieve 100% sensitivity). For Aim 2, we will explore the potential impact of excluding all citations that fall below particular thresholds during the screening process. We will also assess to what extent missing these studies would alter report conclusions. By characterizing potential efficiency gains from new, innovative, and widely accessible tools, this project can facilitate wider adoption by evidence based practice centers seeking to speed systematic review production. Project Narrative Systematic reviews provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of a body of literature and are vital for timely, evidence-based decision-making. However, development of systematic reviews remains too slow, with one particularly time-consuming step being citation screening, in which thousands of research abstracts are manually reviewed to identify a small number of relevant studies. By testing potential gains in citation screening efficiency offered by two innovative, widely-accessible machine- learning tools (Abstrackr and EPPI–Reviewer), and determining if automatically excluding studies to improve speed compromises report conclusions, we hope to enable more rapid production of systematic reviews to inform clinicians and policy-makers and promote high quality, evidence-based patient care.",Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions,9435231,R03HS025859,[' '],AHRQ,ECRI INSTITUTE,R03,2018,95324,-0.011720243739877971
"Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has been demonstrated to markedly improve patient care, but the tools and processes available for physicians to rapidly and meaningfully leverage these guidelines are currently sub-optimal. Compliance improves greatly with the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSS), which implement guideline recommendations and are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems. Unfortunately, CPGs, as commonly distributed, contain recommendations for care of only a single disorder (or class of disorders) and are not easily consumable by computers for integration with CDSS. Recent work has focused on methods to resolve conflicts between guidelines, but only once they are in a computer interpretable form - a Computer Interpretable Guideline (CIG). We aim: to (1) develop a system for computational understanding of CPGs from the unstructured text; (2) to ground the clinical terms in each guideline in its definition so that the produced CIG can better integrate with electronic health record systems; (3) to generate CIGs in a format already developed which allows guidelines to be mediated with each other and allows the creation of CDSS. The project will focus on four clinical guidelines, relating to diabetes, heart disease, non-small cell lung and prostate cancers. Samples of each of the guidelines will be annotated by clinicians with the appropriate output of systems accomplishing each of the three aims. These samples will be split into datasets for testing and for evaluation, with the overall goal to achieve human levels of competence for each aim. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical practice guidelines are paramount to the goals of evidence-based medicine but, being unstructured free text, they are not well integrated with clinician workflows and are not consistently adhered to. We aim to automatically generate computer interpretable versions of textual guidelines in a format which allows for automatic mediation between guidelines for patients with multiple morbidities. Mediated computer interpretable guidelines could then be integrated with electronic medical record systems, providing immediate impact on population health.",Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines,9654971,R15LM013030,"['Belief', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer generated', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel', 'phrases', 'population health', 'prescription procedure', 'syntax', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,COLLEGE AT OSWEGO,R15,2018,325760,-0.0343099382814626
"Epi25 Clinical Phenotyping R03 PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical genetic data suggests that specific categories of epilepsy have genetic contributors, and there may be some overlap between categories. The Epi25 Collaborative was formed among more than 40 cohorts from around the world to sequence as many as 25,000 genomes or exomes. As of 2017, the collaborative has sequenced more than 13,000 exomes and clinical data has been collected for more than 8,000 cases. This project will complete the collection and review of the clinical data for each sample in the Epi25 collection to facilitate the translation of genomic and clinical discoveries into improved care for patients. The clinical and genomic data from Epi25 will be a global resource, shared with the research community for years to come. Epi25's governance structure, membership, and other information are available online at www.epi-25.org. In this project, clinical data is entered by contributors into Red Cap forms or uploaded directly into the Epi25 database. The clinical data is then checked by a computer algorithm that looks for key eligibility criteria for each participant. Errors and missing data are sent to the Phenotyping Coordinator to review and resolve, with the help of the contributing site. PROJECT NARRATIVE In 2014, collaborators from around the world created the Epi25 Collaborative to exome sequence as many as 25,000 patients with epilepsy.

"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,-0.014185567257040411
"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9272400,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2017,188594,-0.019822026011571577
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9323511,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,536041,-0.02586680929544428
"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9427058,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,698661,-0.02178261641575851

"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics.

Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9270528,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,316000,-0.01740330796165659
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

Charles River Analytics and our partners at Massachusetts General Hospital and Virtual Reality Medical Center propose to design and demonstrate Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On-Demand Treatment (CESSATION). We will build VR environments using our in-house game engine and content (cues) that are diverse, realistic, and well-placed, bolstering traditional psychological therapy delivery, and use research-based principles of narrative and game design to produce immersive and engaging content to motivate continued use. We will use probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian networks) and machine-learning (e.g., neural nets) to learn from patient data and clinician input to assist in selecting and combining therapies in a way that is tailored to the individual patient. Finally, CESSATION will communicate information to clinicians in a manner that is understandable, and gives them enough meta-information to foster appropriate trust in the system. The anticipated results of the proposed Phase I work are: (1) an initial domain analysis; (2) initial VR content; (3) initial motivational content; (4) prototype sensor capabilities; (5) a prototype Intervention Tailoring Component; (6) a prototype Clinician User Interface and Remote Patient Data Server; and (7) an initial Phase I CESSATION prototype demonstration and evaluation. n/a","IGF::OT::IGF Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On-Demand Treatment.

"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 – Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 – New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction). Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system,9467160,R43ES029001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Update', 'Work', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'research and development', 'screening', 'success', 'systematic review', 'usability']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2017,211900,-0.010680842664792448
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Policy Surveillance: the Future of Scientific Legal Mapping. “Policy surveillance” is the “ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of information about a given body of public health law and policy” (Chriqui, O'Connor, and Chaloupka 2011). Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws; it can also increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported the development of policy surveillance programs, through NIAAA’s Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) and the National Cancer Institute’s CLASS. More recently, NIDA has funded the launch of two policy surveillance programs, the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (PDAPS) and the Drug Abuse Policy System (DAPS). CDC has been increasing its support for policy surveillance activities, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded a Policy Surveillance Program to provide methodological and technical assistance, and maintain LawAtlas.org, a general health policy surveillance portal. As more and more researchers and consumers enter the field — from the state, federal and international levels and in private industry — harmonization of terms, methodological standards, and consensus on any needed governance mechanisms is valuable to ensure continued growth and adoption of this important scientific process and its valuable products. To meet these needs, we propose to convene one conference of 30-35 invited attendees who represent the practice’s primary stakeholders from across research, technology and practice; develop, publish and disseminate at least one report that summarizes the discussion and consensus reached among attendees; and establish a one-year plan of collaborative work towards further cooperation and cohesion. Project Narrative Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws, can increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations to improve health.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9241259,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,239723,-0.006796081804340279
"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9374626,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,208272,-0.023227659588891836
"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,9313191,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'computer center', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2017,139974,-0.013153258232826693
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9357523,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disorder prevention', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,725048,-0.01357322594240764

"Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5 n psychiatry, clinical judgment has been the predominant method of diagnosis. The `gold standard” for clinical research is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). The SCID-5 promotes reliability, but its validity is questionable. There is growing recognition that biomarkers can be used to identify more homogeneous patient populations, but there is substantial phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia even in identical twins. In the absence of symptom data, biomarkers alone are unlikely to yield a clinical diagnosis.  In a past SBIR project, TeleSage Inc. successfully converted the paper SCID into a web-based software program. The NetSCID-5 is now widely used in research. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the goal of “turning clinical care networks into centers for research” (Insel, Director's Blog, 2012) and furthering the RDoC initiative, we need a means of gathering rigorous diagnostic data in routine clinical care. This software must (a) require minimal clinician time, (b) allow clinics to bill according to the current DSM-5 categories, and (c) be able to gather the large amount of data necessary to inform a broad research agenda including machine learning techniques. TeleSage proposes to develop a self-report diagnostic assessment that satisfies both immediate clinical needs and broader research goals: the “Screening Interview for Diagnosis” or SID.  TeleSage has worked with an expert panel including Dr. Michael First, the primary author of the SCID- 5, iteratively developing and testing self-report items. Based on expert panel review and cognitive interviewing, we identified a final set of 661 unique self-report, Likert-scale items covering all of the individual sub-symptoms described within each of the SCID criteria. TeleSage has also created a behavioral health PORTAL that includes the NetSCID-5, IRT/CAT item administration, randomization, and longitudinal reporting capabilities. The PORTAL exchanges data and reports with several EHRs including the NetSmart EHR system.  This Direct-to-Phase II application aims to create the SID, which will (a) reside on our existing secure web PORTAL, (b) administer simple Likert-scale self-report items, (c) generate DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnoses for billing, (d) use minimal clinician time, (e) pull pre-defined data fields from the EHR (e.g. family history, demographic, and biomarker data), (f) be able to add new self-report items for exploration, (g) integrate with machine learning tools, and (h) send raw data and interpretive reports to EHR systems. Because of these features, we believe that the SID has the potential to be used widely by both clinicians and researchers.  The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5 and to support RDoC. The SID product must be commercially successful and useful both in routine clinical care and research. The SID is intended to facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data, a nosology that is more analogous to those found in other fields of medicine. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) represents the current diagnostic gold standard in behavioral health and yields much more reliable diagnoses than the unstructured patient interviews that predominate in clinical settings; however, the full SCID-5 is a lengthy and complex paper-and-pencil instrument that takes approximately 90 minutes to administer and is thus seldom used outside of clinical research settings. We want to create a new, self-report software tool that will save clinicians time relative to the paper SCID, significantly reduce diagnostic error rates, greatly increase the reliability of diagnoses in routine clinical care, and integrate seamlessly into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems: the Screening Inventory for Diagnosis (SID). The SID is a self-report, computer-adaptive diagnostic assessment, based on easy-to- understand, five-point Likert-scale items. The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5, support RDoC, and facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data.","Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5",9255772,R44MH108177,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Brain scan', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'data exchange', 'disease classification', 'epigenetic marker', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'instrument', 'mental health center', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptom cluster', 'tool', 'usability', 'web portal']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R44,2017,433630,-0.02058807990215511
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants. All of this work will be pursued with our eMERGE III Network colleagues the goal of improving the quality of the health care we deliver.",Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy,9282532,U01HG008666,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Appendicitis', 'Archives', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Sequence', 'Boston', 'Budgets', 'CYP3A5 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Costs and Benefits', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Legal Obligations', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methylphenidate', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Mosaicism', 'Narcotic Addiction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'PTEN gene', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Pyloric Stenosis', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'follow-up', 'gene panel', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'patient oriented', 'pleiotropism', 'preference', 'primary pulmonary hypertension', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2017,811897,-0.04004595252579563
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9385505,K99MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2017,110318,-0.01101941432158833
"All of Us, Wisconsin Our application for OT-PM-16-003, “One in a Million – Precision Medicine Initiative Wisconsin” represents the collaborative efforts of three fully integrated regional healthcare systems to form a virtual state-wide integrated delivery network. The application originates at the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), one of the most productive and earliest adopters of what has become Precision Medicine. The work of the MCHS has been cited by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins as a model for the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). To ensure comprehensive nearly state-wide coverage of participant health care, MCHS has partnered with the other academic integrated delivery networks in Wisconsin, (University of Wisconsin (UW) and Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)), that together include 173 clinics, 13 hospitals, insurer partners and 5 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The Blood Center of Wisconsin (BCW) also partners to operate state-wide mobile units of staff and equipment for blood collection that may be purposed for this effort. Through an independent agreement with Aurora Health, the electronic health records of participants recruited by academic and FQHC sites will be made available, ensuring nearly complete coverage of health care records across an entire state, with special emphasis on those populations that are traditionally the most underserved and understudied. The academic sites and FQHC partners have a long history of research cooperation and robust community engagement demonstrated by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) ties, the Wisconsin Genome Initiative, reciprocal IRB arrangements, multiple joint grants and other collaborative studies. We have pioneered and implemented data sharing platforms and have demonstrated their usefulness with numerous high impact publications over many years. All three academic centers are leaders in the details of community engagement, recruitment, tracking, return of results and data sharing across various platforms in national and international consortia using large cohorts (e.g., MCHS’s 20,000 participant Personalized Medicine Research Project). A major innovation of this application is that it aligns the major healthcare systems of an entire state to more fully capture each participant’s data wherever participants get their health care. Indeed, 80% of all health care in Wisconsin is captured by our footprint. The State-wide catchment area also includes the oldest, sickest and poorest regions in the US and represent rural and urban areas, including African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, all represented as community champions. Through the FQHC partners, the recruiting institutions will achieve the 40% African American, Hispanic and Native American participant rate, with long standing community engagement and history of successful recruitment, including Wisconsin’s 12 Native American Tribes. Lending active support are Community Champions and Community Advisory Boards. A second innovative approach will employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize recruitment and retention processes. Our scientists have long collaborated on efforts to enhance the breadth and reliability of information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), using a range of data to identify elements including family pedigrees or the occurrence of clinical events that are susceptible to unreliable coding. These efforts employed state-of-the-art methods including random forests, support vector machines and statistical relational learning, among others. These advanced computational methods will be used to predict those who are most likely to participate and which methods of approach are most effective. A third innovative approach is the planned use of mobile recruitment labs, previously successful with the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). SHOW, began in 2008 provides a novel infrastructure for population health research recruitment, enabling engagement across the state, longitudinal follow-up of participants and community-specific studies. Key assets of SHOW are two mobile units staffed by research and healthcare professionals to facilitate on-site health studies in randomly selected or community-specific participants. SHOW is predicated on community engagement and the response rate has been outstanding (in one study more than 90% of ~4,000 participants consented to follow-up, DNA testing, or blood work). This is true across all racial/ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. The fourth innovative approach is to work with our FQHC partners to recruit traditionally underserved populations. MCHS, UW and MCW will work with FQHC partners (Marshfield Family Health Center, Access Community Health Center, Milwaukee Health Services, Progressive Health Center and 16th Street Community Health Center). Importantly, we are ready to start. We have already informed and engaged our communities through press releases and newsletters. Processes are in place. Volunteers have already asked us to contact them. All the required personnel are trained and SOPs are in place to begin recruitment. We have a productive history of working with partners already funded for PMI cohort recruitment. For several years, we have worked closely (and published) with our colleagues at Northwestern and Columbia through the eMERGE Network and with the University of Pittsburgh through CTSA. Project Director Murray Brilliant has recently served as an advisor to the University of Arizona’s Precision Medicine Program. Thus, we are team-players who are ready, willing and able to be valuable collaborative partners in the effort to build a national engine to transform healthcare under PMI. n/a","All of Us, Wisconsin",9512099,OT2OD025286,"['African American', 'Agreement', 'Arizona', 'Award', 'Blood', 'Catchment Area', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consent', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Surveys', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Newsletter', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Press Releases', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic pedigree', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'rural area', 'urban area', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",OD,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,OT2,2017,5360833,-0.016100067442351467
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9370683,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2017,1276741,-0.017868938375790122
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9269122,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2017,725442,-0.017404938162124493
"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9288629,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,313412,-0.011327686139192583
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9339455,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2017,500000,-0.01824249198502779
"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9297355,R01LM012095,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobin', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer human interaction', 'data access', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'stem', 'trend', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,444581,-0.017433868677844723
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9270644,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2017,313812,-0.023366189128088084
"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses. (Bioinformatics Resource Core) PROJECT NARRATIVE  The BWH CCCR, or “VERITY” (Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics) Cores will implement novel analytic methods and outcome measures that address existing and emerging needs in clinical research for preventing and treating rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders. The pressing clinical research needs addressed by VERITY include: a) integration of patients’ point of view (patient-centeredness); b) facilitation of innovative trials; c) incorporation of state of the art comparative effectiveness research methods to determine optimal treatments; d) development and testing of innovative behavioral interventions; and e) identification of relevant phenotypes and sub-phenotypes of common and uncommon rheumatic and MSK diseases using electronic medical records (EMRs), registries, cohorts and insurance claims.","VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics",9413618,P30AR072577,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harvest', 'Health Technology', 'Hospitals', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Lupus', 'Measurable', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'behavioral economics', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'distributed data', 'effectiveness research', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment strategy']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,P30,2017,907543,-0.01956082226646324
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract The value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, their primary purpose is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, they have several fundamental limitations. Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). This Phase I project will focus on creating and evaluating a proof of concept system. An engaging, interactive training course using the prototype system will be developed as a case study for clinical nursing training on pressure injuries – an oftentimes preventable injury that is attributed to tremendous human suffering and represents a significant cost burden on our health care system. The course will leverage existing mannequin-based training used at the UMN and be evaluated by both instructors and students at the School of Nursing. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020.

"2018 International Conference on Health Policy Statistics International Conference on Health Policy Statistics (ICHPS) 2018  Specific Aims  The 12th International Conference on Health Policy Statistics (ICHPS), under the timely theme, “Health <-> Statistical Science <-> Care, Policy, Outcomes”, focuses on the interactive relationship between health services research and innovative statistical methodology. It falls within the category of “Research Design and Methodology” in the AHRQ program announcement. The primary sponsor is the Section on Health Policy Statistics of the American Statistical Association (ASA). The 12th ICHPS will be held January 10 to 12, 2018 in Charleston, South Carolina. Details for the last ICHPS conducted in 2015 attended by 246 participants, are available online at: http://www.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2015/index.cfm.  The overarching aim of ICHPS is to create an educational and research forum for statisticians, econometricians, and other research methodologists working on cutting-edge and innovative approaches to exchange and to build upon ideas, and to foster the tradition of linking methodologists with policymakers and other stakeholders in the health services research and health policy arenas to add focus and perspective to the development of new methodological tools. Additional aims of ICHPS 2018 are to increase participation by students and junior investigators, as well as to increase local engagement.  The technical program for the upcoming ICHPS will examine a broad range of topics that fit very well with the goals of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), consistent with previous ICHPS conferences supported by AHRQ. The invited sessions will be useful to promote improvements in the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care by developing, debating and disseminating state-of-the-art research methods. In line with ASA's increasing efforts to engage policy-makers and other stakeholders in health policy, ICHPS 2018 will focus on data-centric statistical methodology related to health services research, and health policy issues of national and international importance.  The invited program includes invited sessions, workshops, contributed talks and posters, in addition to a keynote and a plenary speaker. The confirmed keynote speaker is national expert Dr. Robert Califf, Professor of Medicine at Duke University and former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The confirmed plenary speaker is Dr. Suchi Saria, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, a machine learning expert working on the use of data-driven technology to improve healthcare. Sessions will cover key methodological areas including: causal inference, health disparities research, propensity scores, analysis of complex survey data, heterogeneous treatment effects and individualized treatments, longitudinal modeling, meta-analysis and evidence synthesis, novel trial designs, real-world data, and patient-reported outcomes. Most importantly, the ICHPS program is focused on addressing key health care policy research priorities. Applied topics that have been focal points at recent ICHPS meetings on comparative effectiveness research include examining evidence-based care, patient-reported outcomes analyses, and personalized medicine.  The program will also include roundtable discussions to provide research training and career development for new and current health policy and health services researchers in methods, resources and applications at the forefront of health policy research. Plans for dissemination include pursuing a special issue in Springer's, Health Services and Outcomes Research Methodology for conference proceedings, as was done for 2015 ICHPS (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10742-016-0165-5).

"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.        ",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9112492,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2016,225750,-0.019822026011571577
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9145227,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'international partnership', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,539889,-0.02586680929544428
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care.

"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.        ",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9076555,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,316000,-0.01740330796165659
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9214494,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disorder prevention', 'enteric pathogen', 'falls', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,762222,-0.01357322594240764
"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,9118118,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2016,139974,-0.013153258232826693
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,9108235,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'training opportunity', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2016,137160,-0.0232651600665253
"Hybrid Approaches to Optimizing Evidence Synthesis via Machine Learning and Crowdsourcing Abstract  Systematic reviews constitute the highest quality of evidence and form the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Such reviews now inform everything from national health policy guidelines to bedside care. However, systematic reviews are extremely laborious to produce; researchers can no longer keep pace with the massive amount of evidence now being published.  Semi-automation of systematic review production via machine learning (ML) has demonstrated the potential to substantially reduce reviewer workload while maintaining comprehensiveness. However, it is unlikely that machines will fully supplant human reviewers in the near future. Rather, human experts will probably remain in the loop, assisted by automated methods. Methods that exploit the intersection of human workers and ML models in the context of systematic reviews have not been explored at length. Furthermore, we believe there is substantial untapped potential in harnessing distributed crowd-workers to contribute to systematic reviews, and thus economize expert reviewer efforts. This novel avenue has largely been neglected as a means of increasing the efficiency of review production.  We propose addressing this gap by developing and evaluating novel, hybrid approaches to generating systematic reviews that jointly incorporate domain experts (systematic reviewers), layperson workers recruited via crowdworking platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk and volunteer citizen scientists, while simultaneously capitalizing on ML models.  This innovative, hybrid approach will be the first in-depth exploration of intelligent ML/human systems that aim to reduce the workload in the production of biomedical systematic reviews. Our strong preliminary work demonstrates the promise of this general strategy.   We propose to develop hybrid approaches that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to optimize the conduct of systematic reviews.  ",Hybrid Approaches to Optimizing Evidence Synthesis via Machine Learning and Crowdsourcing,9223968,R03HS025024,[' '],AHRQ,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,98635,-0.017298286459380523
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,9123353,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'skills', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2016,107469,-0.03891556662337235
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9145745,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2016,727321,-0.017404938162124493
"Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records Project Summary/Abstract The implementation of electronic medical record (EMR) systems in routine healthcare has resulted in a rich and inexpensive source of data for translational research. When linked with specimen biobanks, these extensive databases offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the goals of disease genomics as they contain large amounts of detailed clinical and genetic data collected for the purposes of medical care [4; 6; 7; 8; 9]. However, the statistical methods to analyze EMR data are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.  In particular, extracting accurate disease phenotype information is a major challenge impeding EMR-based research [10]. Currently, ICD9 codes are used to conﬁrm presence or absence of a disease in cohorts derived from EMRs. These codes are extremely variable and therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on the statistical power of genetic studies [11; 12]. An alternative approach is to develop a highly accurate algorithm to classify disease status. But due to the laborious medical record review required to obtain validated phenotype information for classiﬁer estimation, phenotypes are only available for a small training set nested in a large cohort. In contrast, predictors of phenotype are available for all observations. To improve accuracy and efﬁciency in model estimation and evaluation, it is therefore of interest to develop semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods that utilize the so- called unlabeled data or observations without conﬁrmed phenotype status in addition to the labeled training set.  Although a great body of literature on SSL exists, nearly all methods concern estimation of classiﬁers or prediction rules when the labeled training set is a simple random sample from the large unlabeled data set [13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21]. Despite the practical importance of evaluating the prediction performance of an estimated model, no SSL procedures currently exist to improve the estimation of model performance parame- ters. Additionally, the simple random sampling assumption is restrictive and the development of semi-supervised (SS) methods that accommodate more ﬂexible sampling schemes in the context of both model estimation and evaluation is needed.  In this proposal, these limitations are addressed through formulation of an efﬁcient method to estimate various prediction performance measures including the ROC curve within the traditional SS framework of simple random sampling. The stratiﬁed random sampling design in the SS setting is also considered and methods to estimate a classiﬁer and its accuracy are developed. These procedures will be applied to EMR-based studies of bipolar disorder and depression. The success of this work will thus improve efﬁciency in analyzing EMR data and expedite the use of EMRs in clinical and genetic research in neuropsychiatry. Project Narrative  The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) in routine healthcare has generated a rich source of data for in-depth study of disease risk factors. However, EMR data typically consists of a very small number of expensive observations with information on disease status and a large amount of automatically extracted data concerning risk factors such as laboratory results and previous health history. Statistical methods that accommodate this data structure are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.",Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records,9192096,F31GM119263,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'success']",NIGMS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2016,34098,-0.017752671288198536

Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data.

"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization. The team members with clinical expertise have been engaged in blood pressure trials in US, and have been working with leading institutions in India engaged in cardiovascular research. This proposal brings together their unique expertise and experience to innovatively address this challenging problem through a joint effort. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unmanaged hypertension is a major problem, and its management based on occasional measurement is known to be suboptimal.

"An Open Source Precision Medicine Platform for Cloud Operating Systems ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rapid improvements in DNA sequencing and synthesis have the potential to usher in a new era of precision medicine. To realize this vision, however, we must re-imagine the computational and storage infrastructure used to manage and extract actionable results from the massive data sets made possible by widely available advances in DNA sequencing and synthetic biology. In conjunction with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), we propose to build the Arvados platform so that a new ecosystem of clinical decision support applications will be able to navigate petabytes of global biomedical data and search millions of genomes in real-time (seconds). Our team has a proven track record of commercial success and high impact scientific research. Commercialization of this free and open-source software (FOSS) platform, which will be greatly accelerated by this grant, will permit organizations to seamlessly span on-premise & hosted cloud- operating systems and vastly simplify data-management & computation, all while facilitating compliance with institutional policies and regulatory requirements.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The delivery of healthcare based on molecular data specific to an individual patient (i.e. precision medicine) will require the creation of a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) applications.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9144440,R01LM012095,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobin', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer human interaction', 'data access', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'stem', 'trend', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,424376,-0.017433868677844723
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9128789,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2016,423432,-0.023366189128088084
"Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr) EMPIRICAL TESTING AND ENHANCEMENT OF WEB-BASED ABSTRACT SCREENING TOOL (ABSTRACKR)  In this year-long project, we aim to empirically assess the performance and efficiency of state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine and stakeholder-driven comparative effectiveness reviews. We have developed AbstrackrTM (hereon, Abstrackr), a human-guided computerized abstract screening tool that aims to reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. Abstrackr makes use of machine learning techniques, and is offered as a free web-based tool that enables management of the screening process.  We also aim to revise the web-interface of Abstrackr to make it more intuitive, user friendly, and add documentation and functionalities requested by users; and to revise Abstrackr’s back-end, which includes the way the software parses and analyses citations, fits machine learning models, and makes computations, to make it more efficient. These revisions will ensure that the tool becomes more robust, and that it remains usable for larger projects and for many teams.  The proposed work will be carried out by the developers of Abstrackr, comprising a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators and computer scientists at Brown University and the University of Texas at Austin, who have been working together for at least seven years. We will pursue dissemination of the findings of this assessment and of the revised tool through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its wider adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center Program, Cochrane Collaboration, and other groups conducting systematic reviews. We will also continue to make all code available online. Our aims are to: Aim 1. Empirically measure the efficiency and accuracy of the prediction algorithms in Abstrackr in the computer-assisted semi-automated screening of citations for eligibility in systematic reviews. Aim 2. Improve and add to the functionality of the Web-based Abstrackr software, based in part on enhancements suggested by a panel of identified heavy users. Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making and systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to assess the performance and efficiency of a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care, and to augment the functionality of its public implementation.",Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr),9168247,R03HS024812,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,99999,-0.001093611936271746

"Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Systematic reviews (SRs), or systematic reviews of literature, summarize evidence drawn from high quality studies, and are often the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting an SR is labor-intensive and time consuming, typically requiring several months to complete. It has been reported that more than ten thousands of SRs are needed to synthesize existing medical knowledge. An Article screening process is one of the most intensive and time consuming steps, which requires SR researchers to screen a large amount of references, ranging from hundreds to more than 10,000 articles, depending on the size of a SR. In the past 10 years, machine learning model training approaches24-29 were developed to accelerate the article selection process through automation. However, they are not widely used due to diffusion challenges.7,14 Major obstacles include 1) a training sample is required to generate the automation algorithm. If the training sample is biased, the article selection process will systematically fail; 2) the automation approach is not made available for non-computer science specialists, therefore SR researchers will not be able to “fine-tune” the automation algorithm for particular conditions in various SR topics; 3) As there is no global automation algorithm, the generalizability is significantly limited; 4) It is difficult to assess the actual workload saved, while finding every relevant article is required in SR. We propose a new approach to provide views of article relationships in an article network. This is different from other bibliometric networks constructing citation, co-author, or co-occurrence networks. Article network is a simple and logical concept: visualizing article relationships and distribution based on articles' similarities in titles, abstracts, keywords, publication types, etc. SR researchers can also alter the article distribution by adjusting the similarities. This approach does not aim to suggest an end-point of the screening process. Rather, it provides a view of distribution for included, excluded, and undecided articles. In the proposed research, we will integrate advanced techniques to sparsify article networks with mixed sparsification methods, and improve the quality and efficiency of large network visualization layouts by constructing a multi-level network structure and advanced force model. We aim to provide approaches to sparsify and visualize article networks with more than 10,000 articles. Our approach is highly generalizable that it can be used for any health science topics. By viewing the article distribution, SR researchers will be able to screen a large amount of literature more efficiently. This approach can be integrated into current SR technologies and used directly by SR researchers. The success of this project can support SR production on any health science topics, and thus streamline their ultimate application in EBP paradigms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systematic reviews (SRs) provide the highest quality of research evidence for patient care. To accelerate the production of SRs, we will implement advanced visualization techniques to view article relationships and distribution with article networks and in a timely and human readable manner. The success of the project will support SR production and thus streamline their ultimate application to evidence-based practice.",Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization,9227858,R03HS025047,[' '],AHRQ,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,100000,-0.011130172056990373
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.            ",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,8964138,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'natural language', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,608132,-0.02586680929544428
"Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A ""meta-study"" (or ""meta-analysis"") collects and analyzes many studies on the same topic to understand if there is a meaningful, overall result. Meta-studies can support (or refute) interventions, spur new investigations, and lead to novel clinical guidelines. However, constructing meta-studies is a time intensive process of searching the literature, compiling the results, and performing the statistical analysis. Due to the time commitment that is required, many topics are unexplored, and many meta-studies are not kept up-to-date with the latest published results. Finally, a number of (unknown) biases, via subjective choices during the meta-study, may influence the results. Our long-term goal is to automate, as much as possible, the meta-study process. This should decrease subjective bias; increase the dissemination of evidence, especially for diseases and interventions that receive less attention; and allow for the automatic updating of meta-studies as new results are published. We propose a computer system that uses statistical machine learning to gather and group studies focused on similar interventions and outcomes; extract the necessary results from the text; and analyze the results using standard meta-analysis techniques. The final output will be presented in a spreadsheet-like Web-interface where users can explore and even change the data and meta-analyses. Our team uniquely blends technical expertise in machine learning with leadership in publishing meta-studies about Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), our disease of focus for our Phase I feasibility study. We are therefore qualified technically and able to ensure that the techniques generate valid and accurate meta-studies. Our Phase I results will define the current state-of-the-art for this novel task. Further, although we will initially focus n IBD, our Phase I results will demonstrate that our approach can generalize to other diseases, eventually applying to any intervention and any disease. The feasibility shown by our Phase I results will motivate our Phase II effort where we will focus on dramatically improving the approach, yielding broad coverage of all medical literature and generating human-quality meta-studies. We note that by the end of Phase I we should have a viable end-to-end prototype, focused on IBD, which we can begin taking to market. The final product should significantly benefit our target markets given the Phase II emphasis to improve the technology, user experience, and scope of covered diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A meta-analysis collects and analyzes the results from multiple studies that are all focused on the same topic, and it can confirm (or refute) the overall effect across the studies, lead to changes in clinical guidelines, or spur new directions for research. However, generating a meta-analysis is an extremely time-consuming process, so many diseases are not covered, and most meta-analyses are not updated to reflect the latest published studies. This work begins to automate the process of creating meta-analyses, overcoming these difficulties in order to make the results published in the medical literature more accessible.",Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials,8977531,R43LM012210,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dourine', 'Ensure', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prototype', 'software development', 'text searching', 'web interface']",NLM,INFERLINK CORPORATION,R43,2015,150000,-0.008715517459361721
"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of features, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combination of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penalization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools availble for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised. This proposal is for new methods for quantifying reproducibility in biomedical data analyses that will have a far-reaching impact on public health by streamlining protocols, reducing costs and offering more effective clinical support systems.",Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays,8828718,R43GM109503,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel diagnostics', 'research study']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R43,2015,64005,-0.02670318526085241
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,8899464,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2015,140335,-0.013153258232826693
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants. All of this work will be pursued with our eMERGE III Network colleagues the goal of improving the quality of the health care we deliver.                ",Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy,8967443,U01HG008666,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Appendicitis', 'Archives', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Boston', 'Budgets', 'CYP3A5 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Cost Analysis', 'Costs and Benefits', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Learning', 'Legal Obligations', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Methylphenidate', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Mosaicism', 'Narcotic Addiction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'PTEN gene', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Pyloric Stenosis', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'design', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'follow-up', 'gene panel', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'pleiotropism', 'preference', 'primary pulmonary hypertension', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2015,855289,-0.04004595252579563
"Protect Privacy of Healthcare Data in the Cloud DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cloud computing is gain popularity due to its cost-effective storage and computation. There are few studies on how to leverage cloud computing resources to facilitate healthcare research in a privacy preserving manner. This project proposes an advanced framework that combines rigorous privacy protection and encryption techniques to facilitate healthcare data sharing in the cloud environment. Comparing to traditional centralized data anonymization, we are facing major challenges such as lack of global knowledge and the difficulty to enforce consistency. We adopt differential privacy as our privacy criteria and will leverage homomorphic encryption and Yao's garbled circuit protocol to build secure yet scalable information exchange to overcome the barrier. Project narrative Sustainability and privacy are critical concerns in handling large and growing healthcare data.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8875578,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,-0.0232651600665253
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery. Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.            ",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9019135,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2015,804679,-0.017404938162124493
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8935819,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2015,107469,-0.03891556662337235
"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization. The team members with clinical expertise have been engaged in blood pressure trials in US, and have been working with leading institutions in India engaged in cardiovascular research. This proposal brings together their unique expertise and experience to innovatively address this challenging problem through a joint effort.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unmanaged hypertension is a major problem, and its management based on occasional measurement is known to be suboptimal.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care.             Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9085705,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2015,388145,-0.023366189128088084

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8892807,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serotonergic System', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2015,56042,-0.05996478256209971
"Informatics to enable routine personalized cancer therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable and therapies targeted to specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. However, even highly-specialized physicians at leading academic centers are not equipped to apply genomic information available in publically available sources to clinical- decision-making concerning individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop informatics tools to support personalized cancer treatment as ""standard of care"" rather than ""one off"" exceptions. We will: 1) implement a bioinformatics pipeline for processing molecular data into actionable profiles, 2) create and maintain a database of therapeutic implications of common genomic aberrations using automated processing of publically-available sources and 3) develop tools to summarize and present patient-specific advice to clinicians. These tools will be based on existing technologies and publicly available data sources. Once tested, we will make these tools available via appropriate open source license.

"Construction of Relation Detection Framework Empowered by Topic Modeling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of large volume of EHRs enhances the possibility for using them for health services, EBM and clinical research. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as relation detections between medical events among unstructured EHRs still pose a big challenge, consequently leading to the inaccuracy of patient cohort identification, especially for cross-institutional environment. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that topic modeling can discover data semantics, which can then be employed as significant cues for diverse relation detections among EHRs. Among them, co-referring, temporal relations and domain semantics are intertwined and positively correlated. Up to now, not much research is done to combine the three relations to build a better patient cohort identification system. Therefore, the PI proposes to develop a relation detection framework for EHRs empowered with topic modeling for more accurate patient cohort identification. In the mentored phase, the PI will implement the relation detection framework under the guidance of my mentor team and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross-institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develo a hybrid design with ICD-9, RxNorm and MeSH ontologies for the data semantics discoveries from EHRs and MedLINE respectively and investigate categorization of data semantics aligning with medical ontologies (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources and more importantly to make corrections or adjustments on data semantics, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The independent phase will be in collaboration with both UTHealth and University of Maryland. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on relation detections among EHRs for efficient patient cohort identification. The PI has strong background in computational linguistics and rich experiences in medical clinical records processing and analyses, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, and Terry Therneau, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored phase will be in Mayo Clinic Rochester where the PI will undertake courses in US healthcare system, health system engineering, clinical statistics and clinical epidemiology and will get mentored training in health informatics which is what he needs to continue to strengthen since he didn't get regular training in his PhD education. In the independent R00 phase, the PI will strive for making independent scientific contributions to the use of informatics for healthcare via the implementation of Aims 2 and 3 and via the independent collaborations internal and externally. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing the construction of medical knowledge systems and clinical practices as well as clinical research.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing accurate and real-time patient cohort identification is not fully realized, because corresponding relation detection systems for medical events among EHRs still need improvements. The proposed framework will enable patient cohort identification that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays  Project Summary. This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of fea- tures, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combina- tion of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penal- ization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools available for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised. This proposal is for new methods for quantifying reproducibility in biomedical data analyses that will have a far-reaching impact on public health by streamlining protocols, reducing costs and offering more effective clinical support systems.            ",Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays,8647816,R43GM109503,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R43,2014,131071,-0.026421911799247216
"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8699494,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,-0.0232651600665253
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.         Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8901369,R44DA035051,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Affective', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antismoking', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bupropion', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clonidine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cytosine', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'GABA Agonists', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mecamylamine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moclobemide', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'Nortriptyline', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Social Welfare', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical efficacy', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'nicotine abuse', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'varenicline']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2014,691074,-0.03539968073756686
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8829434,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,42469,-0.03891556662337235
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation.

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8782905,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2014,53282,-0.05996478256209971
"Informatics to enable routine personalized cancer therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable and therapies targeted to specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. However, even highly-specialized physicians at leading academic centers are not equipped to apply genomic information available in publically available sources to clinical- decision-making concerning individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop informatics tools to support personalized cancer treatment as ""standard of care"" rather than ""one off"" exceptions. We will: 1) implement a bioinformatics pipeline for processing molecular data into actionable profiles, 2) create and maintain a database of therapeutic implications of common genomic aberrations using automated processing of publically-available sources and 3) develop tools to summarize and present patient-specific advice to clinicians. These tools will be based on existing technologies and publicly available data sources. Once tested, we will make these tools available via appropriate open source license.

"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING  PROJECT ABSTRACT Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.            ",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8620889,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198360,-0.010379331265368302
"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.            ",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,8581564,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operator Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2013,140793,-0.013153258232826693

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8528464,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,-0.0232651600665253

"Informatics to enable routine personalized cancer therapy  Program Director/Principal Investigator (Bernstam, Elmer Victor) Abstract Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable and therapies targeted to specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. However, even highly-specialized physicians at leading academic centers are not equipped to apply genomic information available in publically available sources to clinical- decision-making concerning individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop informatics tools to support personalized cancer treatment as ""standard of care"" rather than ""one off"" exceptions. We will: 1) implement a bioinformatics pipeline for processing molecular data into actionable profiles, 2) create and maintain a database of therapeutic implications of common genomic aberrations using automated processing of publically-available sources and 3) develop tools to summarize and present patient-specific advice to clinicians. These tools will be based on existing technologies and publicly available data sources. Once tested, we will make these tools available via appropriate open source license.

"Developing an online educational curriculum to enhance parent-supervised driving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs. The CDC has identified traffic crashes and associated injuries as a top public health priority. Inexperience is the leading cause of crashes among novice teen drivers, but accumulating the necessary experiences to become a safe driver can take many years. Fortunately, evidence from driving and other domains suggests that it is possible to increase experiential knowledge through scenario-based training. Current methods for providing teens with practice focus on parent-supervised driving. However, parents are ill-prepared to handle this role, with many focusing only on the mechanics of driving, laws and general safety advice. Few parents discuss decision-making aspects of driving and may even pass on inaccurate information. Many parents limit the range of driving situations teens are exposed to mistakenly believing that this increases safety rather than dangerously limiting teens' ability to accumulate important driving experience. Our long-term objective is to design and validate an innovative tool that aims to accelerate the acquisition of critical safety knowledge for teen drivers. We propose to extend our team's past work by developing scenarios appropriate for parents to use to mentor their inexperienced teen drivers. The scenarios will be part of an online educational curriculum designed to help parents provide teens with guided practice as they learn how to drive. The online tool will combine scenario- based training with innovative applications of machine learning technology to evaluate scenario responses and provide tailored feedback containing practical, developmentally appropriate strategies for improving safety as well as recommendations for parent-supervised on-the-road practice. Phase I will address these specific aims: 1) Conduct foundational research to identify realistic scenarios commonly encountered by novice teen drivers through semi-structured interviews with teen drivers aged 15-18. 2) Collect representative responses to scenarios from teens with different levels of driving experience and adults to identify the progression of knowledge and identify developmentally appropriate strategies to use as feedback. 3) Create machine learning algorithms to provide tailored feedback and recommend on-the-road driving experiences based on responses to the scenarios. 4) Develop prototype online system. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 5) Develop the Phase I proof of concept into a complete online curriculum with refined algorithms. 6) Evaluate the online curriculum for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a driving simulator experiment and limited field trial with novice teen drivers. The proposed product represents a significant shift in trainig approaches for teen drivers and through Phase III dissemination it will fill a critical need for evidence- based parent-taught driver's education.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs; despite this, many teens' primary source of driver's education is their parents.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.              Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.                   Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.          Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.

"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.

"Optimizing Peripheral Nerve Regeneration using Computational Intelligence based T    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Peripheral nerve injuries are common diseases that affect a large amount of patients every year.  Tissue engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for developing alternative nerve grafts for peripheral nerve regeneration.  Since tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration involve various possible combinations of variables, it is necessary to develop efficient tools to identify optimal tissue engineering strategies and predict the experimental results based on these tissue engineering strategies for peripheral nerve regeneration.  Some research groups have applied artificial neural networks and decision trees to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies.  For the decision trees based methods, it is hard to tell which classification tree is better than the other.  Furthermore, the prediction system using the decision tree algorithm lacks the capability of accumulating the learning experience over time.  On the other hand, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibit some remarkable properties, but only the connection weights are trained with fixed topology.  It is hard to find the best fixed topology in advance for each specific tissue engineering strategy.  In this proposal, swarm intelligence (SI) based evolving ANNs technique is proposed to tackle this challenge.  Two swarm intelligence based methods, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), will be applied in this project to train the ANN model.  More specifically, ACO will be used to optimize the topology structure of the ANN models, while the PSO is used to adjust the connection weights of the ANN models based on the optimized topology structure.  For this SWarm Intelligence based Reinforcement Learning method for ANNs (SWIRL-ANN) system, both topology and connection weight of artificial neural networks can be evolved automatically and simultaneously so that an optimal classifier for tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration can be achieved.  The research project will include the following phases:  Aim 1:  Predict tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration using SWarm Intelligence based Reinforcement Learning method for ANNs (SWIRL-ANN) analytical and prediction system.  Aim 2:  Validate the efficacy of novel unknown tissue engineered nerve grafts as predicted by using SWIRL-ANN based analytical and prediction system for bridging peripheral nerve gaps in rat sciatic nerve injury model in vivo.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tissue engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for developing nerve grafts for peripheral nerve regeneration.

The proposed research will be helpful to efficiently develop tissue engineered products for tissue and organ replacement.            ",Optimizing Peripheral Nerve Regeneration using Computational Intelligence based T,8232817,R15NS074404,"['Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Ants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breathing', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peripheral nerve injury', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'Vertebrates', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'nerve gap', 'nerve injury', 'novel', 'particle', 'relating to nervous system', 'sciatic nerve', 'social', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R15,2011,423840,-0.013993637766179902
"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians. This project investigates a novel combination of past patient data stored in electronic form and statistical machine-learning methods to help develop and refine computer-based alerts, which are expected to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs.",Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design,8139263,R01LM010019,"['Amiodarone', 'Archives', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Opinion', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heparin', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'flexibility', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,366808,-0.016660868426466222
"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.             The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,8055907,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2011,325956,-0.006925628157052159
"NLP for Augmentative and Alternative Communication in Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal relates to the technology of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).  The research, to be developed over the three-year course of this project, relates to increasing communication speed for adult users of typing-based AAC devices. The proposed method has commonalities both with chatter bots and more sophisticated automated question answering systems. In particular, we propose to develop a program that will mine a very large database of stored interactions for sentences that are similar to the sentence currently being uttered by the interlocutor, and propose a set of plausible responses for the AAC user. The outcome of this research will be a system that improves over the current state of the art in whole utterance approaches in AAC, making use of sophisticated natural language processing techniques.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,8306467,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,13000,-0.025750295728011754

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,8115129,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2011,136978,-0.012434014044888081
"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.                Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase I SBIR will lead to a significant increase in the efficiency of manufacture of the PfSPZ Vaccine that will facilitate scale-up of manufacturing and significantly reduce the cost of goods.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel.

"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Machine Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of Bacterial Pathogens  using Laser Light Scattering  PIs: Dr. M.

"Predicting Patient Outcomes from Clinical and Genome-Wide Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Clinical classification and prediction are key components of clinical care. Even modest improvements in classification and predictive performance may have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. This proposal describes a new, efficient Bayesian machine-learning method for performing clinical predictions. The method is designed to use both clinical and genome-wide data in predicting patient outcomes.       The method's performance will be evaluated using existing clinical and genome-wide data from the Framingham Heart Study that is being made available to qualified researchers through the SHARe resource of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The outcomes to be predicted in individuals include the onset of major cardiovascular events and death from all causes. The study will evaluate how well these predictions can be made with a new Bayesian method when using traditional clinical data alone, genome-wide data alone, and both types of data together. The method's performance will also be compared that of existing models and methods.       The main hypothesis to be tested is that the proposed machine-learning method will be an advancement over existing methods in that it will be computationally feasible to apply it using a combination of traditional clinical data and genome-wide data, and it will yield better predictive performance than do existing predictive models and methods. If shown to be so, this new method is anticipated to provide substantial benefit in future electronic patient-care systems, including applications to computer-based decision support that have available both traditional clinical data and genome-wide data.            Predicting whether an individual will acquire a disease is an important clinical task. This project will develop and evaluate a new computer-based method to predict diseases in individuals based on the use of both traditional clinical data and data about an individual's genetic make up.

"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians. This project investigates a novel combination of past patient data stored in electronic form and statistical machine-learning methods to help develop and refine computer-based alerts, which are expected to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs.",Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design,7935413,R01LM010019,"['Amiodarone', 'Archives', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Opinion', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heparin', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'flexibility', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2010,377274,-0.016660868426466222
"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,8142647,R01LM009520,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Discrimination', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Indexes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'indexing', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'statistics', 'stem', 'theories', 'tool']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2010,159993,-0.029325199407125083
"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Prediction of influenza antigenic variants using a novel sparse multitask learnin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza and influenza related complication lead to more than 200,000 hospitalizations and approximately 36,000 deaths in the United States each year, and vaccination is the primary option for reducing influenza effect. A large amount of global efforts has to be made each year to identify antigenic variants and decide whether new vaccine strains are needed. Current laboratory based antigenic characterization processes are labor intensive and time consuming, and it has been the bottleneck for generating an effective influenza vaccination program. A robust method without such a laboratory characterization is demanding for rapid identification of influenza antigenic variants. This project proposes to develop a novel sparse multitask learning method in predicting influenza antigenic variants solely based on the input of protein sequences, and further to apply this method in mapping antigenic drift pathway of A/H3N2 influenza viruses and studying antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This method is based on the assumption that influenza antigenicity would be determined by certain features in hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequence and tertiary structure. This assumption was well evidenced that the viruses with conserved HAs generated cross-reactions in serological reactions and also provided cross- protection in both laboratory experiments and field practices. The proposed method is novel since it combines multitask learning and sparse learning. Therefore not only this project will develop significant technology for antigenic variant screen, but also new machine learning methods. This project will facilitate vaccine strain selection since the proposed method can potentially reduce and even eliminate serological assay, one of the most labor intensive procedures, in influenza surveillance. In addition, the antigenicity specific features and the drift patterns causing influenza outbreaks to be identified in this study will enhance our understanding about antigen-antibody interaction thus enhance our knowledge in influenza immunology and serology. Furthermore, the proposed method is potentially applicable in characterizing antigenic properties of other pathogens with significant antigenic variations, for example, rotavirus. The specific aims are the following: (1) Development of a novel sparse multitask learning method in generating antigenic distance matrix using hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) data; (2) Development of a quantitative method for predicting antigenic variants in silicon; (3) Application of this method in studying seasonal influenza antigenic drift pathway and antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This nature of this study is to address a novel predictive method for measuring antigenic divergence between influenza viruses, which is critical in influenza vaccine strain selection. Thus, we are submitting this project to the broad challenge area (06) Enabling Technologies and fit for the Specific Challenge 06-GM-103: development of predictive method for molecular structure, recognition, and ligand interaction.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is to develop a novel computational method for influenza antigenic variant prediction, which is very useful in influenza vaccine strain selection.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,-0.006925628157052159

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7825424,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2010,185505,0.0021202647510474007
"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7893787,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2010,1512082,-0.025750295728011754
"Enhancing Clinical Effectiveness Research with Natural Language Processing of EMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To successfully use large linked clinical databases for comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires addressing some key informatics challenges associated with distributed, heterogeneous clinical data. Electronic networks of researchers are part of the solution because they can bridge the physical and organizational divides created by distinct health systems' individual electronic medical records (EMRs). In addition, informatics research has demonstrated the feasibility of automatically coding clinical text, enhancing the capacity to integrate both unstructured and non-standardized clinical data from EMRs. With this study, we propose to develop CER infrastructure, make broadly available the proven MediClass technology for automated classification of EMRs containing both coded data and text clinical notes, and demonstrate the potential of this infrastructure for addressing CER questions within the asthma and tobacco-using patient populations of 6 diverse health systems. Asthma and smoking each impose huge and modifiable burdens on the healthcare system, and multiple morbidities related to asthma and smoking have been targeted by the IOM and AHRQ as priority areas in efforts to improve the healthcare system through comparative effectiveness research. We propose to develop, deploy, operate and evaluate the CER HUB, an Internet-based platform for conducting CER, and to demonstrate its utility in studying clinical interventions in asthma and smoking. Researchers who register to use the HUB, beginning with the research team from the 6 participating study sites, will be able to use a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations. A central function of the CER HUB will be facilitating (through online, interactive tools) development of a shared library of MediClass knowledge modules that afford uniform, standardized coding of EMR data. This shared library of knowledge modules could permit researchers to assess effectiveness in multiple areas of healthcare and gain access to data otherwise locked away in text clinical notes. A goal of the CER HUB is to accelerate creation of standardized knowledge used to normalize heterogeneous EMR data as representations of clinical events for CER. During the project period we will conduct 2 studies using this infrastructure to address the effectiveness of interventions for asthmatics and tobacco users across the 6 participating health systems. As an ongoing resource, the HUB will provide a collaborative development platform for enhancing comparative effectiveness research in potentially any health care domain.      CER researchers can build software applications that will process their EMRs, creating standardized datasets permitting CER using a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires that clinical data be in standard forms allowing multiple, large databases to be efficiently combined, and requires that all of the data be coded so that automated summarization of the data is possible. However, much of the clinical data necessary for CER is in the text clinical notes written by clinicians when caring for patients. We will build a centralized website where CER researchers can build software applications that will process their electronic medical records, including both the text and coded data, creating standardized datasets permitting comparative effectiveness research.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7933715,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,388462,-0.012434014044888081
"Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will investigate the influence of social networks on women's decisions to use skilled birth attendants (SBA) and the criteria used in these decisions. The study aims are to 1. Explore the utility of the Network Episode Model of Utilization (NEM) in explaining women's health service utilization decision-making in the context of a normal biological event and, 2. Test the predicative power of women's self identified decision-making criteria on choice of birth attendant in the event of an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. The purpose is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing's mission and area of research emphasis, promoting health and preventing disease. Worldwide an estimated 529,000 women die annually from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications with a disproportionate number (99%) occurring in developing countries. Preventable and treatable conditions such as post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and obstructed labor are the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Use of a SBA to improve identification and management of these conditions is an effective means to reduce maternal mortality. However, SBA services remain underused even in settings where SBAs are available. To understand why women are using or not using SBAs during delivery, the study will employ the NEM to more fully test the influence of socio-structural context on decision making and deliniate the specific criteria used in decision-making through ethnographic decision tree modeling. The study will employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Face-to-face interviews using a structured interview instrument will be conducted with a representative sample of 254 women in Matlab, Bangladesh. This research will provide a model that can be used to investigate health care utilization decision-making in the context of prevention as well as illness response. The relevance to public health and the long term goal of the research is to reduce the high levels of maternal death and disability observed in vulnerable populations both in Bangladesh and the United States.

"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives. We will employ qualitative and quantitative research strategies and determine between and within- person variability in UVR protection and decision-making that will inform the development of interventions to increase UVR protection maintenance among those who are at risk for melanoma.                    Narrative This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase I SBIR will lead to a significant increase in the efficiency of manufacture of the PfSPZ Vaccine that will facilitate scale-up of manufacturing and significantly reduce the cost of goods.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel.

"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7664538,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,318898,-0.01947909264167047

"Predicting Patient Outcomes from Clinical and Genome-Wide Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Clinical classification and prediction are key components of clinical care. Even modest improvements in classification and predictive performance may have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. This proposal describes a new, efficient Bayesian machine-learning method for performing clinical predictions. The method is designed to use both clinical and genome-wide data in predicting patient outcomes.       The method's performance will be evaluated using existing clinical and genome-wide data from the Framingham Heart Study that is being made available to qualified researchers through the SHARe resource of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The outcomes to be predicted in individuals include the onset of major cardiovascular events and death from all causes. The study will evaluate how well these predictions can be made with a new Bayesian method when using traditional clinical data alone, genome-wide data alone, and both types of data together. The method's performance will also be compared that of existing models and methods.       The main hypothesis to be tested is that the proposed machine-learning method will be an advancement over existing methods in that it will be computationally feasible to apply it using a combination of traditional clinical data and genome-wide data, and it will yield better predictive performance than do existing predictive models and methods. If shown to be so, this new method is anticipated to provide substantial benefit in future electronic patient-care systems, including applications to computer-based decision support that have available both traditional clinical data and genome-wide data.            Predicting whether an individual will acquire a disease is an important clinical task. This project will develop and evaluate a new computer-based method to predict diseases in individuals based on the use of both traditional clinical data and data about an individual's genetic make up.

"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7848604,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2009,170861,-0.006925628157052159

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7620994,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2009,263148,0.0021202647510474007

"New Resources for e-Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""New Resources for e-Patients"" addresses the unmet medical needs of consumers who search for health and healthcare information online, currently a population of more than 160 million people in the U.S. It will fill gaps and address deficiencies in currently available online health information resources. It will maximize the value of public domain health information from U.S. Government sources. Textual consumer health information will be collected from NIH, FDA and other government sources. This information will be subjected to automated topic analysis and classification using methods of natural language processing and statistical text-mining to discover and extract topics on i) diseases and conditions; ii) treatments, benefits and risks; and iii) genomic risks and responses. These topics will be integrated and mapped to the most frequent health topics of interest to consumers. Personally-controlled electronic health records and personal genotypes will be studied for their potential contributions to personalized medicine for e-patients. Phase I of this project will achieve proof-of-principle and develop an advanced prototype as a foundation for construction of a new web-based resource in Phase II.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses the unmet medical needs of consumers who search for health and healthcare information online, currently a population of more than 160 million people in the U.S. It will fill gaps and address deficiencies in current online health information resources and also target new opportunities in genomic and personalized medicine. In the process we will create consumer-friendly, automated systems that make online information search and retrieval more efficient more efficient and maximize the value of public domain health information from U.S. Government sources.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors.

We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7911405,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2009,229436,-0.025750295728011754
"Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is the development of an innovative technique to avoid disclosure of confidential data in public use tabular data. Our proposed technique, called Optimal Data Switching (OS), overcomes the limitations and disadvantages found in currently deployed disclosure limitation methods. Statistical databases for public use pose a critical problem of identifying how to make the data available for analysis without disclosing information that would infringe on privacy, violate confidentiality, or endanger national security. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain sensitive elements of information from the data can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially, in some instances, the welfare of the society in which they operate. The challenge is, therefore, to represent the data in a form that permits accurate analysis for supporting research, decision-making and policy initiatives, while preventing an unscrupulous or ill-intentioned party from exploiting the data for harmful consequences. Our goal is to build on the latest advances in optimization, to which the OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) research team has made pioneering contributions, to provide a framework based on optimal data switching, enabling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations to effectively meet the challenge of confidentiality protection. The framework we propose is structured to be easy to use in a wide array of application settings and diverse user environments, from client-server to web-based, regardless of whether the micro-data is continuous, ordinal, binary, or any combination of these types. The successful development of such a framework, and the computer-based method for implementing it, is badly needed and will be of value to many types of organizations, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector, for whom the incentive to publish data is both economic as well as scientific. Examples in the public sector are evident, where organizations like CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau exist for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing data for analysis by other parties. Numerous examples are also encountered in the private sector, notably in banking and financial services, healthcare (including drug companies and medical research institutions), market research, oil exploration, computational biology, renewable and sustainable energy, retail sales, product development, and a wide variety of other areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the process of accumulating and disseminating public health data for reporting purposes, various uses, and statistical analysis, we must guarantee that individual records describing each person or establishment are protected. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. This project proposes the development of a robust methodology and practical framework to deliver an efficient and effective tool to protect the confidentiality in published tabular data.                      n/a",Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid,7790821,R43MH086138,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Client', 'Computational Biology', 'Confidentiality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disclosure', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Security', 'Oils', 'Online Systems', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Support', 'Respondent', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'product development', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIMH,"OPTTEK SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2009,4047,-0.004641646363244495
"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7786337,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2009,362692,-0.012434014044888081
"Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will investigate the influence of social networks on women's decisions to use skilled birth attendants (SBA) and the criteria used in these decisions. The study aims are to 1. Explore the utility of the Network Episode Model of Utilization (NEM) in explaining women's health service utilization decision-making in the context of a normal biological event and, 2. Test the predicative power of women's self identified decision-making criteria on choice of birth attendant in the event of an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. The purpose is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing's mission and area of research emphasis, promoting health and preventing disease. Worldwide an estimated 529,000 women die annually from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications with a disproportionate number (99%) occurring in developing countries. Preventable and treatable conditions such as post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and obstructed labor are the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Use of a SBA to improve identification and management of these conditions is an effective means to reduce maternal mortality. However, SBA services remain underused even in settings where SBAs are available. To understand why women are using or not using SBAs during delivery, the study will employ the NEM to more fully test the influence of socio-structural context on decision making and deliniate the specific criteria used in decision-making through ethnographic decision tree modeling. The study will employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Face-to-face interviews using a structured interview instrument will be conducted with a representative sample of 254 women in Matlab, Bangladesh. This research will provide a model that can be used to investigate health care utilization decision-making in the context of prevention as well as illness response. The relevance to public health and the long term goal of the research is to reduce the high levels of maternal death and disability observed in vulnerable populations both in Bangladesh and the United States. The Healthy People 2010 Objective 16-4 and the United Nations Millennium Development Goal 5 have identified the reduction of maternal mortality as a public health priority.          n/a",Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality,7509937,F31NR010650,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Back', 'Bangladesh', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ethnography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2010', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prenatal care', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Nations', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health Services', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'member', 'network models', 'outreach', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'service utilization', 'social', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,27516,-0.01602778997558788
"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives. We will employ qualitative and quantitative research strategies and determine between and within- person variability in UVR protection and decision-making that will inform the development of interventions to increase UVR protection maintenance among those who are at risk for melanoma.                    Narrative This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives.

"Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window. The significance of this proposal is that successful prediction and early intervention could save thousands of lives annually.          n/a",Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness,7363692,K22LM008389,"['Adverse event', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Sciences', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'inclusion criteria', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'size', 'tool', 'trend', 'vector']",NLM,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K22,2008,135000,-0.03310649598375874
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support.

"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,7435263,R01LM009520,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Discrimination', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Indexes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'indexing', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'statistics', 'stem', 'theories', 'tool']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2008,373392,-0.029325199407125083
"Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medical errors and their timely identification remain an important problem in clinical practice. Electronic medical record repositories and electronic data processing offer an opportunity to identify such errors in time to prevent them or at least attenuate their harm.  Typical computer-based error detection methods rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that is incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. Alerting that is based on knowledge is generally reliable; however, it is time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge, and as a consequence such systems are relatively narrow in their scope.  We propose to develop and evaluate a data-based approach for detecting clinical outliers (anomalies) that is complementary to knowledge-based approaches. This new approach is based on comparing clinical actions, such as medications given and labs ordered, taken for the current patient to those actions taken for similar patients in the recent past, as recorded in a clinical database. If a clinical action for the current patient is highly unusual, then a cautionary alert is raised along with an explanation for why the action appears to be unusual. Key advantages of the new technique are that it works with minimal prior knowledge, and it may detect anomalies for which no rules have yet been written. Thus, this data-driven approach to clinical anomaly detection is expected to complement knowledge-based alerting methods. We propose to implement a data-driven anomaly detection method, and then evaluate it in a laboratory setting using retrospective data for the cohort of surgical cardiac patients.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7354450,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Epidemiology, Other', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'transposon/insertion element', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2008,342967,-0.006925628157052159
"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7502672,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,1432331,-0.025750295728011754
"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7459910,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2008,118789,-0.020545597500921515
"Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is the development of an innovative technique to avoid disclosure of confidential data in public use tabular data. Our proposed technique, called Optimal Data Switching (OS), overcomes the limitations and disadvantages found in currently deployed disclosure limitation methods. Statistical databases for public use pose a critical problem of identifying how to make the data available for analysis without disclosing information that would infringe on privacy, violate confidentiality, or endanger national security. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain sensitive elements of information from the data can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially, in some instances, the welfare of the society in which they operate. The challenge is, therefore, to represent the data in a form that permits accurate analysis for supporting research, decision-making and policy initiatives, while preventing an unscrupulous or ill-intentioned party from exploiting the data for harmful consequences. Our goal is to build on the latest advances in optimization, to which the OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) research team has made pioneering contributions, to provide a framework based on optimal data switching, enabling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations to effectively meet the challenge of confidentiality protection. The framework we propose is structured to be easy to use in a wide array of application settings and diverse user environments, from client-server to web-based, regardless of whether the micro-data is continuous, ordinal, binary, or any combination of these types. The successful development of such a framework, and the computer-based method for implementing it, is badly needed and will be of value to many types of organizations, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector, for whom the incentive to publish data is both economic as well as scientific. Examples in the public sector are evident, where organizations like CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau exist for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing data for analysis by other parties. Numerous examples are also encountered in the private sector, notably in banking and financial services, healthcare (including drug companies and medical research institutions), market research, oil exploration, computational biology, renewable and sustainable energy, retail sales, product development, and a wide variety of other areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the process of accumulating and disseminating public health data for reporting purposes, various uses, and statistical analysis, we must guarantee that individual records describing each person or establishment are protected. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. This project proposes the development of a robust methodology and practical framework to deliver an efficient and effective tool to protect the confidentiality in published tabular data.                      n/a",Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid,7535414,R43MH086138,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Client', 'Computational Biology', 'Confidentiality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disclosure', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Security', 'Oils', 'Online Systems', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Respondent', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'desire', 'innovation', 'interest', 'prevent', 'tool']",NIMH,"OPTTEK SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2008,99843,-0.004641646363244495
"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7340158,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,121564,-0.02674773391641162
"Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window. The significance of this proposal is that successful prediction and early intervention could save thousands of lives annually.          n/a",Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness,7222736,K22LM008389,"['Adverse event', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Sciences', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'inclusion criteria', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'size', 'tool', 'trend', 'vector']",NLM,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K22,2007,135000,-0.03310649598375874
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7242352,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review, Systematic (PT)', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH AND SCI UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,292133,-0.01947909264167047

"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,-0.020704846141939248
"A RuleFit Product for Classification and Regression Prediction and data exploration are important aspects of modern commercial and scientific life. Regression methods predict dependent variables (e.g., tumor growth, severity of disease), while classification methods predict class membership (e.g., tumor or disease type). Both use a vector of independent variables to make the predictions. Because they are often superior predictors, can handle large numbers observations and large numbers of variables, can often yield insight into the data not provided by other methods, and because they can adapt to arbitrarily complex relationships, modern machine learning methods based on tree ensembles such as RANDOM FORESTS and MART have become leading modern analytical methods. Here we propose to commercially implement RULEFIT, a recent innovative method extending the RANDOM FORESTS and MART approaches, that shows strong evidence of being consistently more accurate than either ensemble. RULEFIT also includes groundbreaking new methods for variable selection in the face of huge numbers of predictors, and for identifying interactions, and ranking their importance. Optionally, RULEFIT extracts ""rules"" of special interest: succinct statements of conditions under which an outcome is especially likely or unlikely, or especially large or small. The primary output of RULEFIT is a numeric value reecting a prediction of the value of the dependent variable or the probability of a class membership. RULEFIT is likely to become a leading technique in the machine learning and statistics. It builds on RANDOM FORESTS and MART and includes all their useful benefits such as variable selection, data exploration, data reduction, outlier detection, and missing value imputation, while enhancing and extending these benefits.  COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL The market for advanced analytical tools has been growing strongly over the last decade and the growth shows no signs of diminishing. Modelers and data analysts in both university- based and commercial settings are increasingly aware of the power and value of new analytical tools derived from modern statistics and machine learning research. The increased accuracy of the new methods and the acceleration they provide to the analysis of complex data are fueling demand for this new technology. The advances embedded in the proposed product represent substantial improvements to existing technology and include methods to solve vexing problems in contemporary data analysis, and thus should find a welcoming market.  There are further reasons to forecast robust commercial potential for this product. The applicant organization has a strong track record in the industry and is widely recognized as a developer of high quality software. We have been working with consultant Friedman since 1990 and have gained exclusive rights to the proprietary sourcecode for a number of his innovations. These include CART, MARS, MART and PRIM. With the addition of RULEFIT and its associated sub-components, these products represent a unique collection of pedigreed tools. We have also forged a similar relationship with the (late) Leo Breiman and have the exclusive rights to commercialization of Breiman's Random Forests sourcecode. Our proposed package thus occupies a distinctive position in machine learning software which cannot be replicated by other vendors. Keywords: machine learning; classi?cation; prediction; supervised learning; variable importance; inter- action detection; Justi?cation Dr. Steinberg has extensive experience in software development for advanced statistical and machine learning methods, particularly in the area of classi?cation and regression trees, sur- vival analysis, adaptive modeling, RANDOM FORESTS and MART. He will oversee all aspects of the project. He will will work with Dr. Cardell, Professor Friedman, Mr. Colla, and with the Salford Systems software development engineer in creating and studying the software and methods used in this proposal. He will also be responsible for the architecture of the Phase I software. Professor Friedman and Dr. Cardell will provide technical support as follows: Dr. Fried- man is an expert on machine learning methods and is one of the developers of the RULEFIT technique. Regular consultation with him will be in this area. Dr. Cardell is an expert in asymptotic theory, and in the design of Monte Carlo and other tests for the evaluation of ma- chine learning algorithms. He also has extensive experience in machine learning, including adaptive modeling, neural networks, logistic regression, and classi?cation methods. He will review core algorithms of RULEFIT for possible improvement and extension and design the Monte Carlo tests. Mr. Colla has extensive experience in software development and with machine learning methods, including work on the commercial implementations of CART, MARS, RANDOM FORESTS, and MART. Working with Dr. Cardell, he will be responsible for much of the new software coding. 5 Project Description Page 7 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Steinberg, Dan Prediction models based upon classification and regression tree ensembles have become important in medical and other research.

"The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to create software that uses mathematical algorithms to detect medical billing coding errors prior to payment. The well-publicized failure of current healthcare cost containment technologies to prevent improper payments in both the commercial healthcare market and the federal Medicare program highlights the urgent need for a new approach to the growing problem of out of control medical costs. A recent federal study by the GAO estimated that improper payments by Medicare alone were in excess of 21 billion dollars, a truly staggering 48.1 percent of all improper payments by federal programs. Like SPAM, whose dynamic nature makes static or post hoc remedies ineffective, effective cost containment in one area often merely leads to the creation of new areas of abuse. Clearly, the ideal solution is a system that can evaluate the fairness of payments before they are made, and that can respond to dynamic patterns of abuse. The first step in creating such a system is the creation of robust method for sorting bills for appropriate rule-based analysis on the basis of the type of bill. Currently neither Medicare nor major insurers are capable of making this classification reliably except through the use of inefficient, static rules and the use of manual sorting--a costly and inefficient approach to assuring timely payment to hospitals and medical providers. We propose a novel method for using mathematical algorithms that utilize machine-learning (ML) methods to address the problem of medical bill categorization, the first step in coding error detection. Specifically, we propose the evaluation of a variety of genetic algorithms that are well adapted to the problems of large, dynamic datasets and can be ""trained"" using real world correctly coded datasets in healthcare claims. This work is particularly timely due to recent Medicare contracting reform. Using more than 50 contractors and carriers, bill classification is largely determined by the carrier's contract. Centralizing this process to only four payment centers will require the classification system we propose. [This research is directed toward the development of software applications that will detect billing errors and perform proper edits to payment of medical bills. Current anticipated changes and reforms in the Medicare system will require these systems, which do not currently exist in the public or private sector.]             n/a",The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments,7316071,R43LM009190,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contractor', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Fraud', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Industry', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'mathematical algorithm', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'software development', 'stem', 'success']",NLM,"QMEDTRIX SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2007,92482,-0.014010670558696458
"Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medical errors and their timely identification remain an important problem in clinical practice. Electronic medical record repositories and electronic data processing offer an opportunity to identify such errors in time to prevent them or at least attenuate their harm.  Typical computer-based error detection methods rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that is incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. Alerting that is based on knowledge is generally reliable; however, it is time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge, and as a consequence such systems are relatively narrow in their scope.  We propose to develop and evaluate a data-based approach for detecting clinical outliers (anomalies) that is complementary to knowledge-based approaches. This new approach is based on comparing clinical actions, such as medications given and labs ordered, taken for the current patient to those actions taken for similar patients in the recent past, as recorded in a clinical database. If a clinical action for the current patient is highly unusual, then a cautionary alert is raised along with an explanation for why the action appears to be unusual. Key advantages of the new technique are that it works with minimal prior knowledge, and it may detect anomalies for which no rules have yet been written. Thus, this data-driven approach to clinical anomaly detection is expected to complement knowledge-based alerting methods. We propose to implement a data-driven anomaly detection method, and then evaluate it in a laboratory setting using retrospective data for the cohort of surgical cardiac patients.  The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in a hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.          n/a",Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.,7197167,R21LM009102,"['Anticoagulants', 'Arts', 'Attenuated', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flushing', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Heparin', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources Management', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2007,161562,-0.02489336829790146
"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7262592,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease regression', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2007,263847,0.0021202647510474007
"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7427367,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,U01,2007,1463449,-0.025750295728011754
"Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary. This project will investigate and develop effective information technologies for comparative analysis and visualization of complex data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). GCxGC is an emerging technology that provides an order-of-magnitude greater separation capacity, significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and higher dimensional retention-structure relations than traditional GC. The principal challenge for utilization of GCxGC, in a wide range of public-health and other applications, is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large, complex data it generates. The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data necessitates the investigation and development of new information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate innovative methods and tools for comparative analysis of GCxGC datasets. The expected results of this research and development include a PCA-based method for chemical fingerprinting, decision trees with chemical constraints for sample classification, genetic programming for template and constraint-based matching and classification, and visualization methods for comparative GCxGC analyses. These methods will be implemented in commercial software that will support researchers and laboratory analysts in a wide range of commercial applications, including health care, environmental monitoring, and chemical processing. The power of GCxGC, supported by effective information technologies, will enable better understanding of chemical compositions and processes, a foundation for future scientific advances and discoveries. Relevance to Public Health. Today, a few advanced laboratories are pioneering GCxGC for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring of exposure profiles in air, soil, food, and water; identification and quantification of toxic products in blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and qualitative and quantitative metabolomics to provide a holistic view of the biochemical status or biochemical phenotype of an organism. Many analyses in these applications require detailed chemical comparisons of samples, e.g..monitoring changes, comparison to reference standards, chemical matching or ""fingerprinting"", and classification. GCxGC is a powerful new technology for such comparative analyses. This proposal will provide innovative information technologies to support users in these applications.           n/a",Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC,7270029,R44RR020256,"['Air', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Blood', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fingerprint', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Information Technology', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Soil', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Today', 'Trademark', 'Urine', 'Water', 'base', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'commercial application', 'comparative', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'research and development', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCRR,"GC IMAGE, LLC",R44,2007,239373,-0.023530864255425377
"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal.

"Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will investigate the influence of social networks on women's decisions to use skilled birth attendants (SBA) and the criteria used in these decisions. The study aims are to 1. Explore the utility of the Network Episode Model of Utilization (NEM) in explaining women's health service utilization decision-making in the context of a normal biological event and, 2. Test the predicative power of women's self identified decision-making criteria on choice of birth attendant in the event of an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. The purpose is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing's mission and area of research emphasis, promoting health and preventing disease. Worldwide an estimated 529,000 women die annually from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications with a disproportionate number (99%) occurring in developing countries. Preventable and treatable conditions such as post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and obstructed labor are the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Use of a SBA to improve identification and management of these conditions is an effective means to reduce maternal mortality. However, SBA services remain underused even in settings where SBAs are available. To understand why women are using or not using SBAs during delivery, the study will employ the NEM to more fully test the influence of socio-structural context on decision making and deliniate the specific criteria used in decision-making through ethnographic decision tree modeling. The study will employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Face-to-face interviews using a structured interview instrument will be conducted with a representative sample of 254 women in Matlab, Bangladesh. This research will provide a model that can be used to investigate health care utilization decision-making in the context of prevention as well as illness response. The relevance to public health and the long term goal of the research is to reduce the high levels of maternal death and disability observed in vulnerable populations both in Bangladesh and the United States. The Healthy People 2010 Objective 16-4 and the United Nations Millennium Development Goal 5 have identified the reduction of maternal mortality as a public health priority.          n/a",Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality,7407646,F31NR010650,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Back', 'Bangladesh', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Condition', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ethnography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2010', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prenatal care', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'RQ2', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United Nations', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health Services', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'member', 'network models', 'outreach', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'service utilization', 'social', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,43435,-0.01602778997558788
"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7212022,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,R21,2007,122600,-0.02674773391641162
"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy.

"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,7245581,R01LM009520,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2007,380625,-0.029325199407125083
"Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal has been developed in response to PAR-02-062 (Building Translational Research in Behavioral Science). The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that an explicitly translational, multidisciplinary approach to defining the role of dopamine (DA) in schizophrenia (SC), is capable of illuminating some of the most poorly understood, most treatment-resistant cognitive and motivational aspects of the illness. Specifically, recent basic research has shown that DA cell firing plays a critical role in the encoding of reward prediction and reward based learning. The proposed work will provide a rigorous test of the applicability of this hypothesis as a framework for understanding the motivational and learning impairments of SC with important implications for schizophrenia therapeutics. To test this hypothesis, we have organized a group of basic and clinical investigators into three scientific modules:1) electrophysiology, 2) neuroimaging, and 3) behavior, with the overall program designed to address different aspects of same theory of DA function. These modules are designed to develop collaborative partnerships with the results of initial pilot experiments used to refine hypothesis for further experimental testing. Initial studies are proposed to document the specific behavioral, electrophysiological, and fMRI Bold signal abnormalities of SC patients during the performance of reward learning paradigms, the impact of different antipsychotics on reward processing in animals, and the physiological sequela associated with reward-driven changes in DA cell firing. Computational modeling will be used to determine whether the experimental results in animals and observed deficits in patients are consistent with the hypothesized role of DA in reward processing. The overall program is designed to develop resources, paradigms, and proof of principle studies that illuminate the nature of DA dysfunction in SC through the application of translational paradigms and models demonstrating the critical role of DA in reward and reinforcement learning. If successful, the proposed work is designed to establish the conceptual foundation and preliminary data needed to support individual RO1 applications and a Translational Center.         n/a",Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia,7278791,R24MH072647,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Habenula', 'Haloperidol', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'heuristics', 'human study', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'olanzapine', 'programs', 'quetiapine', 'research study', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'theories', 'translational approach', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2007,342842,-0.016995246602603938
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window. The significance of this proposal is that successful prediction and early intervention could save thousands of lives annually.          n/a",Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness,7106109,K22LM008389,"['clinical research', 'heart arrest', 'model']",NLM,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K22,2006,135000,-0.03310649598375874

"Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop EMS/IM ITS, a suite of simulation-based intelligent tutoring systems and scenarios that will enable practice-based learning of WMD emergency medical services incident management principles and skills, including situation assessment, decision-making, and real-time execution of EMS tasks within an incident command structure. To support practical and economical development of many EMS/IM ITS training scenarios, we will also develop software tools and development methods that enable efficient authoring of new scenarios and adaptation/enhancement of existing scenarios by instructors or subject matter experts, without programming. We will leverage our tutoring system development tools and our experience developing tutoring systems for medical training, command and control, and tactical decision-making.

"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,7109222,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2006,483334,-0.023313519939152635

"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7052491,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2005,180862,-0.024964150892130634

"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6924688,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2005,167063,-0.04262096605838837
"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation.

"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects. During Phase II, the pressurization capabilities of the new probe will be further developed and examined.

"A Run-to-Run Algorithm for Glucose Regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long term objective of this work is to develop new algorithmic approaches to optimize the delivery of insulin in an automated fashion to people with type 1 diabetes. Specifically, we aim to develop a strategy, inspired by run-to-run control theory established by the chemical process industries, that ""learns"" from the previous sequence of glucose responses to insulin dosing (over the course of days), and optimally predicts the appropriate strategy for the forthcoming day. The notion of a ""cycle"" in engineering will be extended to manage the 24 hour routine of repeated meals, activities, and sleep cycles and the corresponding dosing of insulin. The algorithm will be tested in both simulation and clinical trials for robustness to sensor noise, uncertainty in the patient characterization, variability in the timing of the postprandial glucose peak, and variability in the carbohydrate content in the meals. The Specific Aims of this project are to: i) construct predictive patient sensitivity models for calculation of optimal insulin dosing from elevated (or depressed) glucose levels, ii) develop run-to-run algorithm for insulin bolus dosing to provide corrections in subsequent days based on previous history of glucose levels and insulin dosage, and iii) evaluate the robustness of the algorithm through meal challenges of varying carbohydrate content. The aims will blend prototype algorithms that are drawn from systems engineering with validation in a series of clinical tests. The proposed collaboration between systems engineers and renowned diabetes researchers in an established clinical research setting will allow a novel fusion of methods that can be truly characterized as ""innovative"". The medical collaborators in the proposal are located at the prestigious Sansum Medical Research Institute, which is located less than 10 miles from the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution.

To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.      Specific Aims (R33 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop a neural network MPCE system and test it initially in animals (Year 3).   Aim 2 - Refine parametric mapping and test reproducibility of MPCE data in humans (Year 4).   Successful completion of this project will result in noninvasive, quantitative, objective, and reproducible interpretation of LV function, thus facilitating optimal diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in cardiology. n/a",Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography,6783325,R21HL070363,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'echocardiography', 'evaluation /testing', 'heart function', 'human subject', 'method development', 'swine']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC,R21,2004,144693,-0.0204483933854209

"Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computerized radiation therapy planning systems (RTP) are essential in Radiation Oncology for quantitative evaluation of radiation doses prior to patient treatment. Among currently available computational methods, the Monte Carlo method of calculating dose distributionsis most universal and accurate. It is believed that Monte Carlo software packages will become a central part of future RTP systems. The limiting problem with current Monte Carlo codes is the length of time (CPU time) required for calculations even when using state-of-the-art hardware. An increase in efficiency of Monte Carlo codes has been demonstrated using algorithms known as variance-reduction techniques (VR techniques), but the calculation times are still too long for routine  clinical use. While there is no single VR technique that would make Monte Carlo code clinically viable, a combination of such techniques usually results in improved performance. At present, the only commercial RTP system using Monte Carlo code for photon dose calculations is PEREGRINE from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NOMOS Corporation. PEREGRINE uses several VR techniques. However, it is estimated that a further reduction in CPU time by a factor of 10 would be required to have a clinically efficient system.  Our theoretical study and subsequent Monte Carlo results support a new variance-reduction technique (NVR) for photon-beam dose calculations. It is shown that NVR yields up to a 5-fold reduction in CPU time. The long-term objective of the project is to reduce PEREGRIN's CPU time from currently several hours to several; minutes. This will require a combination of NVR with other VR techniques. Within this scope, the specific aims of Phase I are:  1. Development, implementation and validation of a PEREGRINE-specific NVR algorithm.  2. Benchmarking of NVR over the range of clinically useful energies in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms.  3. Validation of NVR in the case of patient-specific Monte Carlo calculations using CT based patient anatomy. n/a",Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE,6787955,R41CA108088,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electromagnetic radiation', 'mathematics', 'patient care planning', 'radiation dosage', 'radiation therapy', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,NOMOS CORPORATION,R41,2004,100000,-0.020557126998143965
"A Run-to-Run Algorithm for Glucose Regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long term objective of this work is to develop new algorithmic approaches to optimize the delivery of insulin in an automated fashion to people with type 1 diabetes. Specifically, we aim to develop a strategy, inspired by run-to-run control theory established by the chemical process industries, that ""learns"" from the previous sequence of glucose responses to insulin dosing (over the course of days), and optimally predicts the appropriate strategy for the forthcoming day. The notion of a ""cycle"" in engineering will be extended to manage the 24 hour routine of repeated meals, activities, and sleep cycles and the corresponding dosing of insulin. The algorithm will be tested in both simulation and clinical trials for robustness to sensor noise, uncertainty in the patient characterization, variability in the timing of the postprandial glucose peak, and variability in the carbohydrate content in the meals. The Specific Aims of this project are to: i) construct predictive patient sensitivity models for calculation of optimal insulin dosing from elevated (or depressed) glucose levels, ii) develop run-to-run algorithm for insulin bolus dosing to provide corrections in subsequent days based on previous history of glucose levels and insulin dosage, and iii) evaluate the robustness of the algorithm through meal challenges of varying carbohydrate content. The aims will blend prototype algorithms that are drawn from systems engineering with validation in a series of clinical tests. The proposed collaboration between systems engineers and renowned diabetes researchers in an established clinical research setting will allow a novel fusion of methods that can be truly characterized as ""innovative"". The medical collaborators in the proposal are located at the prestigious Sansum Medical Research Institute, which is located less than 10 miles from the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6792043,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2004,153537,-0.023313519939152635
"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data. Commercialization is expected as subscription service not unlike current bioinformatics databases, granting investigators access to a large-scale, globally distributed data warehouse comprised of participating PACS-enabled medical centers. n/a",Access to distributed de-identified imaging data,6777517,R43EB000608,"['archives', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'health care policy', 'health related legal', 'human data', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems']",NIBIB,"HX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2004,149200,-0.030561945747134646
"Development of Ultrasonic Appratus for Dental Diagnosis DESCRIPTION: An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as demineralization/caries, hidden fractures, and formation of abscesses. The equipment adopts a piezoelectric and laser optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation of teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will be analyzed by a pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the diagnosis of the tooth inspected.

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.

"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"Development of a Multi-State Decoding Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to increase the capability and decrease the cost of decoding the Illumina bead array platform by adding decode states. DNA probes attached to microbeads are randomly loaded onto fiber optic bundles. A decoding process of sequential hybridization stages is necessary to determine the locus correspondence of each bead. Decoders (sequences complementary to the DNA probes on the beads) that are either unlabeled, or labeled with a dye are hybridized to the array. Images are taken after each hybridization, and the experiment is designed so that the hybridization signature of each bead through the decode process, uniquely determines the identity of the bead. The cost and time of decoding is proportional to the number of decode stages. The number of stages is determined by the number of loci represented on the array and the number of distinguishable labels, or decode states, used in the decode process (e.g. ON in dye 1). The current availability of 3 states allows the decoding of 1,500 probes in 8 stages. The successful execution of this project would extend the number of states to at least 8. With 8 states, the number of stages for the 1,500-probe product would become 4. The number of probes that could be decoded in 8 stages would increase by 3 orders of magnitude. The main components of the project are wet lab chemistry and algorithm development. Wet lab chemistry will be used to determine the optimal mixture of dye labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides that will lead to distinguishable intensity states. Beads will have signal levels in FAM and CY3 dye. Variability in the process will need to be sufficiently low to reliably distinguish different concentrations of dye labeled oligonucleo tides. Three levels of FAM and CY3 signal would lead to 9 states. It is likely that 8 of these will be reliably distinguishable. Pattern matching algorithms will be developed to decode the beads. Decision tree methods based on expected signal will be applied. Arrays will be decoded twice -- first with the current 3-state decoding, and then with the multi-state decoding -- to enable training and machine learning algorithms. Achieving 8 state decoding will decrease the cost of the array and dramatically increase the number of loci explored and the number of probes per locus. n/a",Development of a Multi-State Decoding Framework,6737095,R43HG003096,"['chemistry', ' cost effectiveness', ' dyes', ' mathematics', ' microarray technology', ' nucleic acid probes', ' technology /technique development']",NHGRI,"ILLUMINA, INC.",R43,2003,141830,-0.01018903686643114
"Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While density-functional calculations of the energy are now feasible for biomolecules, the use of density-functional geometry optimizers is still confined to relatively small molecules containing no more than thirty atoms. The key limitation of conventional density-functional geometry optimizers is that the cost of the geometry optimization scales at least quadratically with the number of atoms in the molecule. In contrast the energy at a fixed geometry can be evaluated for a cost which scales linearly with molecule size, enabling very large molecules to be treated. This proposal is based on a radical change in the algorithm for density-functional geometry optimization, potentially reducing the total cost from quadratic to linear in molecule size and enabling a quantum leap in the size of molecules that can be optimized. The proposed algorithm resembles a conventional self-consistent calculation of the energy at a fixed geometry but at convergence the proposed algorithm yields not only the density but also the optimized geometry. This is achieved by simultaneous optimization of the wavefunction and the geometry via a modified self-consistent-field procedure. The proposed algorithm will be implemented in the QChem software package and, if successful, widely distributed through QChem Inc. and Spartan Inc.           n/a",Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules,6583907,R43GM067335,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical models', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' mathematics', ' molecular dynamics', ' molecular size', ' quantum chemistry']",NIGMS,"Q-CHEM, INC.",R43,2003,99639,-0.014268873480021444
"Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) This project will examine new methodology for making inference about the regression parameters in the presence of missing covariate data for two commonly used classes of regression models.  In particular, we examine the class of generalized linear models for general types of response data and the Cox model for survival data.  The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Also, parametric models for the covariate distribution will be examined.  The methods of estimation will focus on the Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990) and other related iterative algorithms.  The Gibbs sampler (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) along with the adaptive rejection algorithm of Gilks and Wild (1992) will be used to sample from the conditional distribution of the missing covariates given the observed data.  ii) examine estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  iii) develop and study Bayesian methods of inference in the presence of missing covariate data when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Parametric prior distributions for the regression coefficients are proposed.  Properties of the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients will be studied.  The methodology will be implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods similar to those of Tanner and Wong (1987). iv) investigate Bayesian methods when the covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Multinomial models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Dirichlet prior distributions for the multinomial parameters will be investigated.  2) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates.  Specifically, we will  i) develop and study estimation methods for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates. Methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous will be studied.  The methods of estimation will focus on an EM type algorithm similar to that of Wei and Tanner (1990).  ii) study estimation of the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanisms nonignorable.

Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.      Specific Aims (R33 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop a neural network MPCE system and test it initially in animals (Year 3).   Aim 2 - Refine parametric mapping and test reproducibility of MPCE data in humans (Year 4).   Successful completion of this project will result in noninvasive, quantitative, objective, and reproducible interpretation of LV function, thus facilitating optimal diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in cardiology. n/a",Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography,6688878,R21HL070363,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' echocardiography', ' evaluation /testing', ' heart function', ' human subject', ' method development', ' swine']",NHLBI,"MAYO CLINIC COLL OF MEDICINE, ROCHESTER",R21,2003,136861,-0.0204483933854209
"Smart Power Assistance Module for Manual Wheelchairs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use power assistance as the basis for a Smart Power Assistance Module (SPAM) that provides independent power assistance to the right and left rear wheels of a manual wheelchair. The SPAM will detect obstacles near the wheelchair, and modify the forces applied to each wheel to avoid obstacles.  For individuals with visual impairments that are unable to walk with a long cane or walker, the SPAM will provide safe travel by assisting the user to avoid obstacles. This research will build on the investigative team's previous experience with power assistance for manual wheelchairs and obstacle avoidance for power wheelchairs and rollators.

The present application concerns the creation        of methods for the definition and analysis of novel histopathologic features         predominantly derived from nuclear image data, with the objective of defining        ""prototype identities."" According to the investigator, these are fundamental         complexes of histologic features unique to individual tissue samples, or small       groups of such samples, that should convey useful predictive value for               individual patients. Many of these features are not normally discernable to the      eye, even to the experienced observer. They encompass a large number of primary      and derived nuclear morphometric measures, including what are referred to as         ""weak features,"" that is those that have not in the past shown strong                correlative utility by standard statistical measures.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6633609,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2003,618638,-0.015610540338005524

"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6688775,R21NS045410,"[""Parkinson's disease"", ' abnormal involuntary movement', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' electromyography', ' human subject', ' method development', ' neuromuscular disorder', ' psychomotor function', ' tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2003,178485,-0.023313519939152635
"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data. Commercialization is expected as subscription service not unlike current bioinformatics databases, granting investigators access to a large-scale, globally distributed data warehouse comprised of participating PACS-enabled medical centers. n/a",Access to distributed de-identified imaging data,6694270,R43EB000608,"['archives', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' health care policy', ' health related legal', ' human data', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems']",NIBIB,"HX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2003,250800,-0.030561945747134646
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6538211,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,403006,-0.020251395195750397

The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.

"Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) This project will examine new methodology for making inference about the regression parameters in the presence of missing covariate data for two commonly used classes of regression models.  In particular, we examine the class of generalized linear models for general types of response data and the Cox model for survival data.  The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Also, parametric models for the covariate distribution will be examined.  The methods of estimation will focus on the Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990) and other related iterative algorithms.  The Gibbs sampler (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) along with the adaptive rejection algorithm of Gilks and Wild (1992) will be used to sample from the conditional distribution of the missing covariates given the observed data.  ii) examine estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  iii) develop and study Bayesian methods of inference in the presence of missing covariate data when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Parametric prior distributions for the regression coefficients are proposed.  Properties of the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients will be studied.  The methodology will be implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods similar to those of Tanner and Wong (1987). iv) investigate Bayesian methods when the covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Multinomial models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Dirichlet prior distributions for the multinomial parameters will be investigated.  2) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates.  Specifically, we will  i) develop and study estimation methods for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates. Methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous will be studied.  The methods of estimation will focus on an EM type algorithm similar to that of Wei and Tanner (1990).  ii) study estimation of the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanisms nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Bayesian methods similar to those of 1-iii) and -iv) will be investigated.

The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Also, parametric models for the covariate distribution will be examined.  The methods of estimation will focus on the Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990) and other related iterative algorithms.  The Gibbs sampler (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) along with the adaptive rejection algorithm of Gilks and Wild (1992) will be used to sample from the conditional distribution of the missing covariates given the observed data.  ii) examine estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  iii) develop and study Bayesian methods of inference in the presence of missing covariate data when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Parametric prior distributions for the regression coefficients are proposed.  Properties of the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients will be studied.  The methodology will be implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods similar to those of Tanner and Wong (1987). iv) investigate Bayesian methods when the covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Multinomial models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Dirichlet prior distributions for the multinomial parameters will be investigated.  2) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates.  Specifically, we will  i) develop and study estimation methods for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates. Methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous will be studied.  The methods of estimation will focus on an EM type algorithm similar to that of Wei and Tanner (1990).  ii) study estimation of the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanisms nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Bayesian methods similar to those of 1-iii) and -iv) will be investigated. Computational techniques using the Monte Carlo methods described in 1-iii) will be implemented.  n/a",Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates,6513068,R01CA074015,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' method development', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,R01,2002,21871,-0.0063291656707035295

"Actuarial Generation of Diagnostic Possibilities in Ment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this Phase I project is to test the feasibility of a computerized diagnostic tool for collaborative assessment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.  Such a system is sorely needed in both clinical and research settings because (a) structured clinical interviews, although the gold standard in diagnosis, are time consuming and underutilized, and (b) the clinical judgment that is often substituted is of Limited accuracy and subject to several significant biases.  Using the diagnostic rules from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the proposed product will provide clinicians with automated actuarial symptom and diagnostic data thereby circumventing these limitations while assisting the collaborative diagnostic process.  These goals will be accomplished by integrating a reliable and valid symptom checklist filled out by patient informants with an advanced rule-based documentation system that employs an established logic-processing engine and which utilizes the complete DSM-IV rule set.  Based on the presence and severity of discrete symptoms, clinicians will be provided with actuarially derived probability values that indicate the likelihood of specific DSM-IV criteria or disorders.  Additionally, it will facilitate rapid and complete documentation DSM-IV criterion necessary to formally validate or refute diagnoses.  The improved integration of client and clinician information will provide increased diagnostic precision and facilitate collaboration between providers and clients.  In Phase II, the system will be extended to support repeated assessment, direct access via the World Wide Web, and larger sampling to collect further psychometric information.  Phase I objectives include: 1. To produce a highly usable collaborative diagnostic assessment tool that will be used by individual practitioners, small group practices and their clients.  2. To automate the determination of the positive and negative predictive power of informant symptom data for corresponding DSM-IV criterion and diagnoses, and to collect an initial data set to evaluate usability and psychometric properties of the system.  Phase II objectives include: (1) creation of a user interfaces and program logic to support repeated assessment (2) scaling to provide direct access via the World Wide Web and (3) larger sampling to extend the known psychometric properties of the system.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Commercial potential is present in several areas related to psychiatric diagnosis and clinical decision-making: clinical practice, enterprise decision support, training, education, research, medical records, and managed care.   n/a",Actuarial Generation of Diagnostic Possibilities in Ment,6549219,R43MH062266,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' psychometrics']",NIMH,"MEDICINE RULES, INC.",R43,2002,99996,-0.004596520705750205
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6538226,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2002,66954,-0.022229097843569624
"Pharmacogenetic Prediction of Paroxetine Response  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes the development of a computational model, called GeneRx, to incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-schizophrenic therapy on a patient specific basis.   Preliminary studies on the anti-schizophrenic drug olanzapine show a 40% patient-by-patient error between predicted starting dose and optimal therapeutic dose, using a prototype trained only with patient chart information. This is a significant reduction from the range of starting doses for olanzapine currently used, which is from 1 to 80 mgs/day. Anti-schizophrenic drugs likewise have a large window of therapeutic options, including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies used. Using patient-specific genetic information in conjunction with patient medical chart information, obtained from schizophrenia studies performed by outside sources, we propose to develop computational models to predict efficacy of treatment (i.e. Response/Non-response) to the neuroleptic risperidone. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA from the blood samples, scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key schizophrenia-related genes. GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and predict if the patient will respond initial risperidone drug therapy. Response will be measured by change in standard severity test scores. A more efficient method to prescribe effective anti-schizophrenic pharmaceuticals would expedite recovery, minimize side effects, and reduce medical costs.   n/a",Pharmacogenetic Prediction of Paroxetine Response,6550614,R43MH066671,"['antipsychotic agents', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavioral genetics', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' depression', ' genetic polymorphism', ' genotype', ' human genetic material tag', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' paroxetine', ' pharmacogenetics', ' serotonin inhibitor']",NIMH,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2002,100000,-0.03436524742807318
"Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This SBIR Phase I application proposes to extend an existing multi-tier Internet client-server system (""CliniMetricar"") by integrating active diagnostic logic.  CliniMetrica currently provides systematic psychiatric assessment using the World Health Organization (WHO) Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, version 2.1). CliniMetrica automatically indexes digital audio recording of assessment interviews, and was developed with SBIR support from NIMH Digital video functions are currently being implemented and tested with additional NIMH support, as are functions to support remote psychometrics for the training and monitoring of interviewers.  The CliniMetrica system is increasing in sophistication and functionality, and has applications for clinical research (e.g., clinical trials) as well as for more routine clinical practice.  The current lack of fully developed and tested diagnostic functionality is a major gap.  A number of potential customers have requested integrated DSM-IV and/or lCD-10 diagnostic results to be automatically linked to assessments.  In order to meet this market need, we propose to implement the DSM-IV and ICD-10 nosologic systems as two classification knowledge bases that a logic engine will process to generate diagnostic results.  These logical functions are difficult to implement and manipulate with procedural languages (e. g. C + +). so the use of a logic engine provides significant technical benefits.  This diagnostic logic version of CliniMetrica is referred to as ""CliniMetrica-Dx.""  To assist raters in thorough examination and to support adaptive assessment, a user interface coupled to logic processing modules will allow tracking the diagnostic status of a subject (the sets of true, false, partially true, or partially false DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses during assessment.  The logic engine will dynamically generate assessment item subsets (currently from the SCAN) needed to rule-in or rule-out DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses. During the assessment, presentation of these symptom sets to the assessor can further guide the interview. By narrowing the ""search space,"" the efficiency of assessments will be increased. By formalizing the search, reliability and validity can be enhanced In addition, to provide support for nosologic research and development, in Phase II the system will include mappings between DSM-IV and lCD-10, and between current and future versions of the DSM and lCD.  The CliniMetrica-Dx system as an application framework will generalize to other clinical psychiatric assessment instruments such as the SCID, to adaptive self-report systems, and to other medical specialties.  It also will have applications for education and training.   n/a",Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry,6549963,R43MH066434,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human subject', ' indexing', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' psychometrics']",NIMH,"MEDICAL DECISION LOGIC, INC.",R43,2002,94169,-0.006367568656747702
"Advaced Cross-Correlator Development of a general purpose ultrasound cross-correlator module that is proposed for a) blood flow estimation in one, two and three dimensions b) blood flow estimation in an overlapped mode for use in high frequency small vessels c) coded excitation deconvolution d) A-Mode tissue characteristic correlation quantification The module would be capable of accepting Digitized RF data at rates up to 4o million 12 bit samples per second from a beamformer and returning the Sum of the Products (SOP) of multiple selectable ranges of up to 48 samples with a theoretical accuracy of 1/128th of a sample in the range dimension and a dynamic range of 36 bits in the intensity dimension at the rate of the input data. Multiple results based upon the SOP would also be output. The chosen algorithms would be loaded through a Firewire interface to a personal computer (PC) in a sub second rates. The correlator modules would output its results again through the Firewire interface into the PC for further image optimization and viewing. Initially the module would be tested with the company's Beamformer but efforts would be made to offer a universal interface so researchers could utilize the computing power of the correlator on other instruments.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine.

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This proposed project has       three primary objectives. Objective 1 is to develop improved strategies for          fitting more accurate classification and regression tree (i.e., CART) models.        Objective 2 is to develop a formal framework to allow statistical inference on       tree models. Objective 3 is to develop and distribute public-domain software         that will allow applied data analysts to implement the methods we develop in         the first two objectives. To meet these objectives we will integrate                 statistical and computational machine learning approaches.

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription. We will directly sell our software products and services to Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and to Transcription Services Companies.  n/a",Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems,6528412,R44LM006930,"['computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' language', ' medical records', ' speech recognition', ' telemedicine', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"ESCRIPTION, INC.",R44,2002,325555,-0.06021604837773509
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured.

"Development of Ultrasonic Apparatus for Dental Diagnosis   DESCRIPTION: Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed (Phases 1 and 2)      for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as                     demineralization, caries, fractures, abscesses, and tooth wear. The equipment        adopts piezoelectric and optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation on       teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will then be analyzed by a        pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the         diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to      reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinic and also contribute       to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. In the Phase 1 research, tooth           specimens will be collected from local Dental clinics; demonstration                 instrumentation will be constructed; ultrasonic testing will be conducted on         the tooth specimens in vitro; and finally, the test data will be analyzed to         show the potential for Dental pathology identification. The feasibility of the       proposed research concept will be demonstrated, if: 1) meaningful ultrasonic         tests can be conducted using the simple piezo-/opto-ultrasonic system on the         tooth specimens collected; 2) various Dental pathologies in the tooth specimens      may be characterized by using wave pattern of the ultrasonic responses; and 3)       by identifying particular features of an ultrasonic wave pattern, the actual         tooth pathology may be recognized.

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6388212,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2001,604881,-0.04085322264310918

"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6340157,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2001,68753,-0.022229097843569624
"LATENT SEMANTIC INDEXING IN SUPPORT OF DATA RETRIEVAL We propose to extend the successful work we have achieved with                   statistically based indexing and retrieval systems, by incorporating             semantic structures which accommodate the modifying attributes of clinical       conCepts.

"Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) This project will examine new methodology for making inference about the regression parameters in the presence of missing covariate data for two commonly used classes of regression models.  In particular, we examine the class of generalized linear models for general types of response data and the Cox model for survival data.  The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Also, parametric models for the covariate distribution will be examined.  The methods of estimation will focus on the Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990) and other related iterative algorithms.  The Gibbs sampler (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) along with the adaptive rejection algorithm of Gilks and Wild (1992) will be used to sample from the conditional distribution of the missing covariates given the observed data.  ii) examine estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  iii) develop and study Bayesian methods of inference in the presence of missing covariate data when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Parametric prior distributions for the regression coefficients are proposed.  Properties of the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients will be studied.  The methodology will be implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods similar to those of Tanner and Wong (1987). iv) investigate Bayesian methods when the covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Multinomial models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Dirichlet prior distributions for the multinomial parameters will be investigated.  2) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates.  Specifically, we will  i) develop and study estimation methods for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates. Methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous will be studied.  The methods of estimation will focus on an EM type algorithm similar to that of Wei and Tanner (1990).  ii) study estimation of the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanisms nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Bayesian methods similar to those of 1-iii) and -iv) will be investigated.

The present application concerns the creation        of methods for the definition and analysis of novel histopathologic features         predominantly derived from nuclear image data, with the objective of defining        ""prototype identities."" According to the investigator, these are fundamental         complexes of histologic features unique to individual tissue samples, or small       groups of such samples, that should convey useful predictive value for               individual patients. Many of these features are not normally discernable to the      eye, even to the experienced observer. They encompass a large number of primary      and derived nuclear morphometric measures, including what are referred to as         ""weak features,"" that is those that have not in the past shown strong                correlative utility by standard statistical measures.

"Nosocomial infections: Automated typing and data mining   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nosocomial infections cause about 90,000        deaths annually in the U.S. and have an associated medical care cost of about        3.5 billion dollars. Despite being the fourth leading cause of death, there has      been limited development of rapid, integrated tools for determination of             outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections. The goal of the proposed research is      to test feasibility of development of software algorithms for identifying            clusters of bacteria involved in nosocomial infections. This will be                 accomplished by creation of new algorithms for clustering bacterial fatty acid       composition data to detect infection clusters and through the creation of a          ""data mining"" algorithm to provide patient demographic information needed to         distinguish nosocomial outbreaks from community-acquired infections or               pseudo-outbreaks.

"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6467733,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2001,607570,-0.015610540338005524

"RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS  DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             Machine learning methods are innovative tools used to find patterns in medical       data.  Laboratory data is suited to computerized Interpretation because of its       objective, quantitative nature.  Body fluid analysis is a good model for             evaluating machine learning in the laboratory.  Pathologists spend a                 substantial amount of time analyzing and classifying body fluids, or                 effusions, which are abnormal accumulations of fluid within body cavities of         human beings and animals, caused by diseases such as congestive heart failure.       Fluid classification provides clinicians with important diagnostic information       about the underlying disease process.  Automation of body fluid analysis by a        machine learning system would substantially increase the efficiency and              profitability of a medical laboratory.  In a pilot study, RIPPER (Repeated           Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction), a rule discovery tool,              accurately classified effusions from animals into five standard categories,          based on the physical, chemical, and cellular characteristics of the fluid.          The purposes of this study are: 1) to determine the accuracy of RIPPER on a          larger data set, to expand and strengthen the results of the pilot; 2) to test       the accuracy of RIPPER's fluid classifications prospectively in a large              veterinary teaching hospital laboratory, 3) to determine the acceptance rate         or reason for rejection of RIPPER's classification by clinical pathologists;         and (4) to use RIPPER to discover novel rules for classifying effusions by           underlying disease process.                                                                                                                                               The results of this study will validate and test the acceptance of a machine         learning system applicable to fluid analysis in both human and veterinary            clinical laboratories.  By discovering new patterns in quantitative data that        identify the specific underlying disease, RIPPER can greatly enhance the             diagnostic value of laboratory analysis.                                                                                                                                  n/a",RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS,6467346,F32LM000095,"['body fluids', ' classification', ' computer assisted instruction', ' programmed instruction', ' veterinary science']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS,F32,2001,52501,-0.008963394633924657
"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time. If the data         are supportive, these developments have the potential to significantly advance       the manner in which future diagnostic interviews are conducted with mental           health populations.                                                                                                                                                       n/a",ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT,6392530,R03MH060134,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' anxiety', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' child behavior disorders', ' child psychology', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' depression', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' model design /development', ' mood disorders', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2001,60756,-0.0007460718824391273
"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This proposed project has       three primary objectives. Objective 1 is to develop improved strategies for          fitting more accurate classification and regression tree (i.e., CART) models.        Objective 2 is to develop a formal framework to allow statistical inference on       tree models. Objective 3 is to develop and distribute public-domain software         that will allow applied data analysts to implement the methods we develop in         the first two objectives. To meet these objectives we will integrate                 statistical and computational machine learning approaches. We believe our work       can have a significant impact in biomedical data analysis by combining the           strengths of statistics for developing objective criteria for model selection        and for providing a framework for assessing and quantifying uncertainty              associated with a model, with the strengths of machine learning for fitting          models to large and complex datasets.                                                                                                                                     n/a",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES,6387141,R01GM061218,"['classification', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2001,163400,-0.017759866995280326
"Allergy Alerts in Computerized Physician Entry   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):                                                 Computerized physician order entry (POE) has helped reduce medication errors,        and a substantial amount of error reduction stems from its allergy alerting          function. However, our experience has taught us that these systems should be         improved for safer medication delivery. We recently performed an analysis of         the user responsiveness to allergy alerts, and found that it was lower than          expected (50% in 1994); moreover it had been declining for several years (to         20% in 1999).                                                                                                                                                             In our analysis, we learned several lessons. One is that the allergy screening       software may be too richly cross-referenced, and therefore generates excessive       alerts. In addition, some allergy alerts are consistently ignored based on           accepted clinical practice, but their importance has not been tested. Also,          present systems lack stratification of allergy severity, and fail to                 distinguish between medication tolerance and true allergies. By over-alerting,       the overall integrity of the system is degraded.                                                                                                                          We seek to improve the computer-based intelligence of the allergy alerting           process. Our study is designed to accomplish several goals. We will evaluate         the frequency and significance of adverse drug events that resulted from             overridden allergy alerts. Next, we will determine if distinguishing true            allergic reactions from symptoms of medication intolerance will result in            improved compliance to allergy alerts. Finally, we aim to design an allergy          classification system that incorporates severity analysis that would otherwise       be performed off-line by pharmacist oversight.                                                                                                                            We believe the results of our work will improve patient safety and the overall       quality of pharmacotherapy.

"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription. We will directly sell our software products and services to Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and to Transcription Services Companies.  n/a",Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems,6404288,R44LM006930,"['computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' language', ' medical records', ' speech recognition', ' telemedicine', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"ESCRIPTION, INC.",R44,2001,673495,-0.06021604837773509
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6031325,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2000,433383,-0.020251395195750397

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6054979,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2000,593340,-0.04085322264310918
"ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC LOGIC FOR PSYCHIATRY   DESCRIPTION: (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): This Phase I project          proposes to assess the feasibility of an advanced diagnostic logic system            (Diagnostica) to support the clinical assessment process for diagnosis in            psychiatry. A working prototype of the diagnostic rules in the American              Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) uses and          artificial intelligence engine (""XSB"") to implement the logic of DSM-IV along        with and an interactive graphical user interface to allow a user to add              information and understand conclusions reached by the system. The Phase I            programming objectives are to make Diagnostica ready for commercial use by           improving its graphical user interface, and finalizing implementation of its         logical rules. The resulting system will be a practical tool in clinical             settings, and relies on computer science innovations that have preciously            neither been explored nor applied in the domain of medical reasoning. With the       emergence of decision support systems, the need for better quality diagnostic        information is becoming increasingly apparent. This has been due, in part, to        the complexity of diagnostic processes and the emphasis on support of financial      processes. Within mental health, the DSM-IV provides both a model and a              standard for making diagnoses. A software component that provides flexible,          complete, and efficient application of this standard is of great value. The          innovation of Diagnostica relies on the sophistication of its modeling of            DSM-IV rules, and it's flexibility in applying those rules. Diagnostica will         automatically track the status of the information entered and allow users to         tie up 'loose ends' in documenting the proof of diagnoses formally. AS example,      the user may indicate that a set of diagnoses in 'believed true' without             specifying the symptoms needed to make the diagnoses formally ( a procedure          used routinely in clinical practice). the application will track whatever            'residual' data this is necessary in order to complete formal diagnoses, while       leaving the option of when, or if, to complete the process up to the user.                                                                                                Phase II objectives include: (1) extending Diagnostica to provide other              software applications needing diagnostic decision support services, and              specifically to link Diagnostica to the World Health Organization Schedules for      Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN); (2) addressing logical modeling       of time and creating an effective user interface for repeated assessment; (3)        incorporating probabilistic information about sets of symptoms based on              empirical information initially obtained in Phase I; and (4) developing and          testing ""belief revision"" functions to changes in knowledge stemming from            repeated clinical assessment.

"NEW ROC METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  Receiver Operating             Characteristic (ROC) analysis is recognized widely as the best way of            measuring and specifying the accuracies of diagnostic procedures, because it     is able to distinguish between actual differences in discrimination              capacity, on one hand, and apparent differences that are due only to             decision-threshold effects, on the other.  Key methodological needs remain       to be satisfied before ROC analysis can address all of the practically           important situations that arise in diagnostic applications, however.  This       project employs signal detection theory and computer simulation to address       several of those needs, by:  (1) refining and continuing distribution of         software developed previously by the applicants for fitting ROC curves and       for testing the statistical significance of differences between ROC curve        estimates; (2) developing and evaluating new algorithms for ROC                  curve-Fitting and statistical testing, based on their recently-developed         ""proper"" binormal model, that should provide more meaningful results in          experimental situations that involve small samples of cases; (3)                 investigating the usefulness of a form of ROC methodology that is based on       mixture distributions in order to rduce the need for diagnostic truth in ROC     experiments; (4) investigating the effect of case-saple difficulty on the        statistical power tests for differences between ROC curves, in order to          determine the optimal difficulty of cases that shouldbe studied on rank          diagnostic systems; and (5) developing methods for training artificial           neural networks (ANNs) to maximize diagnostic accuracy in terms of ROC           analysis and signal detection theory.                                             n/a",NEW ROC METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY,6181168,R01GM057622,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' method development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2000,218176,-0.01586795562253062

"IMPROVED COLLIMATION FOR PIXELATED RADIATION DETECTORS   DESCRIPTION: The investigators propose to test the feasibility of developing         improved collimators for use with higher performance pixelated detectors under       development for use in gamma cameras now under development, as further               described by their abstract:                                                                                                                                              ""In nuclear medicine, the collimator plays a critical role in the formation of       a projection image of the radiopharmaceutical distribution within a patient.         The current state-of-the-art of collimator design for Nuclear Medicine has           matured, under the assumption that gamma-ray detectors have an intrinsic             position dependant Gaussian response function. A fundamental rethinking of           collimator design is necessary to optimize collimation for solid state               detectors that have a fixed intrinsic rect function response. We will construct      design tools by first developing a mathematical model of collimation for             detectors with intrinsic pixels and then implement it by computer algorithms.        We will conduct experiments to measure performance and validate the simulation       tools. Using the validated simulator we will then explore novel collimator           designs and hole patterns. We will examine all proposed designs for                  sensitivity, resolution, cost and manufacture. To advance clinical                   applications, collimator design will need to keep pace with the anticipated          improvements in detector technology.

"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This research will provide a means to optimize structured recording of patient test results in a computer-searchable format improving the process of procedural reporting, and facilitating implementation of an electronic medical record.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING,6141030,R43HL062806,"['artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' echocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' human data', ' informatics']",NHLBI,"CYBERPULSE, LLC",R43,2000,107000,-0.019300631708326816
"CLINICAL RESEARCH TOWARD CLOSED LOOP INSULIN DELIVERY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The ""closed-loop                artificial pancreas,"" a device that would measure glucose level and              deliver insulin automatically as needed, has been an elusive goal in the         treatment of diabetes. There are three essential components: the blood           glucose sensor, linking algorithms and the delivery system. For the first        time, a viable sensor and a proven delivery system are now available for         research. The broad goal of this clinical research proposal is to complete       the studies needed to link the sensor to the delivery system, paving the         way for a functional closed-loop artificial pancreas. First, we will make        a detailed analysis of sensor signal as it reflects glucose level in             normal and diabetic humans. Second, we will study the precise                    pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery by external and implantable insulin         pumps. Third, analysis of these two data sets will provide the basis for         algorithms that link the sensor signal to insulin delivery. A formal             safety analysis will evaluate the safety features needed in a closed loop        device. In the last year of the project, the entire system will be tested        and fine-tuned. This project takes advantage of our relatively extensive         investigational experience with mechanical insulin delivery pumps in             people with diabetes, and the recent availability, for research, of a            subcutaneously placed, glucose oxidase-based continuous glucose sensor.          The investigators have established experienced with clinical research in         diabetes, and the resources of an excellent General Clinical Research            Center. The co-investigators have extensive experience with mathematical         modeling of biologic systems. There is a close working relationship              between the research team and the manufacturer of the sensor and pumps, as       reflected by the Interactive Research Project Grant collaboration, and by        a long-standing history of collaboration. It is essential to emphasize           that we do not anticipate completion of a manufacturable, clinically             usable, commercially viable artificial pancreas within the time-frame of         this work. Rather, we aim to complete the basic studies and modeling             analyses that would form the basis of such a system, and demonstrate the         feasibility of linking the sensor to the delivery device. If these studies       and these trials were successful, they would be a major step towards             development of a clinically useful close-loop artificial pancreas.                n/a",CLINICAL RESEARCH TOWARD CLOSED LOOP INSULIN DELIVERY,6177804,R01DK055132,"['artificial endocrine pancreas', ' artificial intelligence', ' biosensor device', ' clinical research', ' drug delivery systems', ' glucose metabolism', ' human subject', ' insulin', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' medical implant science', ' pharmacokinetics']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,252566,-0.004596327988241788
"KNOWLEDGE BASED TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION OF CLINICAL DATA Abstractions of time-stamped clinical data are useful for planning               therapy, for monitoring therapy, and for creating high-level summaries of        time-oriented clinical databases.  Temporal abstractions also support            explanations by an intelligent patient-record system and can be used for         representation of the goals and intentions of clinical guidelines and            protocols.                                                                                                                                                        We propose to reengineer and expand the scope of the RESUME system, a            prototype computer program that implements the knowledge-based temporal-         abstraction method, a conceptual and computational framework that we have        developed for abstraction of time-stamped clinical data into clinically          meaningful interval-based concepts. RESUME has been evaluated with highly        encouraging results in several clinical areas. We will address the               practical and theoretical issues of representation, acquisition,                 maintenance, and reuse of temporal-abstraction knowledge. Our specific           aims are defined by a four-step research plan:                                                                                                                    1. We will define formally the knowledge requirements for five                   computational modules (mechanisms) we employ, thus facilitating the              acquisition, maintenance, reuse, and sharing of the required knowledge.                                                                                           2. We will enhance, expand, and redesign five computational temporal-            abstraction mechanisms:                                                          (a) Automatic formation of meaningful contexts for interpretation of             clinical data.

(c) Temporal inference (e.g., the join of certain interval-based clinical        abstractions into longer ones).                                                  (d) Interpolation between temporally disjoint clinical abstractions,             including a development of a probabilistic representation and semantics.         (e) Matching of predefined and runtime temporal patterns, given time-            stamped data and conclusions.                                                                                                                                     3. We will develop a tool for automated acquisition, from expert                 physicians, of temporal-abstraction knowledge, using techniques from the         PROTEGE-II project for designing knowledge-based systems.                                                                                                         4.

(a) We will assess the value of the knowledge-acquisition tool in several        experiments.                                                                     (b) We will validate the performance of the computational mechanisms in          the domain of therapy of patients who have insulin-dependent diabetes by         collaboration with expert endocrinologists.

"WAVELET-BASED AUTOMATED CHROMOSOME IDENTIFICATION Commercial automated karyotyping instruments have improved to the point where the major factor limiting throughput is the time required for operator correction of chromosome classification errors. An improvement in chromosome classification accuracy would significantly increase the value of these instruments in cytogenetics labs. The goal of this project is to develop and commercialize significantly improved chromosome measurement and classification techniques for automated karyotyping. Currently the best-performing chromosome classification approach uses Weighted Density Distribution (WDD) features [11] to quantify the banding pattern of the chromosomes. These are computed as inner products between the banding profile and a set of WDD basis functions. The particular set of 1unctions originally proposed by Granum [11,38] has come into widespread use. In Phase I we showed that better function sets exist and that our new approach can find better WDD features than the best currently used. We have an innovative wavelet-based method for generating WDD functions and a chromosome classification testbed which supports large scale classification experiments. We propose to conduct a thorough, methodical search for better performing basis functions in Phase II. Phase III will incorporate the technology into PSI's PowerGene automated karyotyping instruments.

"LATENT SEMANTIC INDEXING IN SUPPORT OF DATA RETRIEVAL We propose to extend the successful work we have achieved with                   statistically based indexing and retrieval systems, by incorporating             semantic structures which accommodate the modifying attributes of clinical       conCepts. Patient data is rarely limited to a single axis of meaning or          detail, and retrieval for application in quality improvement, decision           support, or epidemiologic research, demands Consistent information               struCture.

The     project will focus on the domain of childhood immunization, and will build       upon IMM/Serve, a childhood immunization forecasting program that takes as       input a child's immunization history, and produces recommendations as to         which vaccinations are due and which vaccinations should be scheduled next.      The effort required to modify and validate such a program as the clinical        field evolves over time is a challenging task.  It will be extremely             important to have a robust set of tools to assist in this process.  Partial      prototype versions of certain of these tools already exist.                                                                                                       1.  The project will refine and extend computer-based tools for immunization     knowledge maintenance.  These tools will include:  a) IMM/Def, a program         which automatically generates the rule-based logic for the most complex          portion (""kernel"") of IMM/Serve's knowledge, and b) IMM/Test, a program          which automatically generates a set of test cases to help test the kernel        logic.  The project will also develop an organized set of strategies for         immunization test case generation, and implement those strategies in the         refined version of IMM/Test.                                                                                                                                      2.

"ASSESSING NEW MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR MEDICAL EVENTS Predictive models that generate estimate probabilities for medical outcomes have become widely used in health services research, in health policy, and increasingly, for the assessment of health care and for real-time decision support.  Logistic regression models for medical events are central to most probabilistic predictive clinical decision aids and are fundamental to comparative analyses of medical care based on risk-adjusted events.  In such applications, inaccurate assessment of patient risk can have significant health care and health policy implications. New computer-based modeling techniques including generalized additive models, classification trees, and neural networks may potentially capture information that regression methods may miss or misrepresent.  However, these methods use very local information in model construction and may be overfit to the sample data and thus not transport well to new settings.  In years 1-3, we investigated the relative accuracy of predictions made by these modeling methods under a variety of data structures, including the presence of outliers and missing data. For many of these data structures we found that the more ""local"" procedures frequently did not generalize to new test data as well as traditional regression methods.  However, our results suggest that as sample size and data complexity increases the performance of these procedures may substantially improved. Thus, to test these findings under more general conditions, we now propose two additional years of research to 1) rigorously assess the relative predictive performance and transportability of other new innovative modeling methods and of original hybrid model construction methods; 2) systematically investigate the relative predictive performance and model transportability of modeling methods applied to large and complex data structures; and 3) explore and assess procedures for handling outliers and missing data for classification trees and neural networks. The completion of the proposed work will result in the first systematic exploration of the factors affecting the predictive performance of the major modeling methods used to predict medical outcomes, and the comparative performance of models constructed by these methods on the extremely large data sets of the type that are becoming increasing available to researchers.  n/a",ASSESSING NEW MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR MEDICAL EVENTS,6185210,R01LM005607,"['artificial intelligence', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer simulation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' outcomes research', ' prognosis', ' statistics /biometry']",NLM,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2000,270618,-0.02067006305624004

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6062376,R21CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2000,154460,-0.015610540338005524
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.                                                                                                                                                      During Phase I, we developed signal processing algorithms that permit            noninvasive assessment of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.           T algorithms were tested on patient data and found to assist clinicians          in predicting patient response to cardioversion in an attempt to                 terminate the arrhythmia and restore sinus rhythm.

"RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS  DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             Machine learning methods are innovative tools used to find patterns in medical       data.  Laboratory data is suited to computerized Interpretation because of its       objective, quantitative nature.  Body fluid analysis is a good model for             evaluating machine learning in the laboratory.  Pathologists spend a                 substantial amount of time analyzing and classifying body fluids, or                 effusions, which are abnormal accumulations of fluid within body cavities of         human beings and animals, caused by diseases such as congestive heart failure.       Fluid classification provides clinicians with important diagnostic information       about the underlying disease process.  Automation of body fluid analysis by a        machine learning system would substantially increase the efficiency and              profitability of a medical laboratory.  In a pilot study, RIPPER (Repeated           Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction), a rule discovery tool,              accurately classified effusions from animals into five standard categories,          based on the physical, chemical, and cellular characteristics of the fluid.          The purposes of this study are: 1) to determine the accuracy of RIPPER on a          larger data set, to expand and strengthen the results of the pilot; 2) to test       the accuracy of RIPPER's fluid classifications prospectively in a large              veterinary teaching hospital laboratory, 3) to determine the acceptance rate         or reason for rejection of RIPPER's classification by clinical pathologists;         and (4) to use RIPPER to discover novel rules for classifying effusions by           underlying disease process.                                                                                                                                               The results of this study will validate and test the acceptance of a machine         learning system applicable to fluid analysis in both human and veterinary            clinical laboratories.  By discovering new patterns in quantitative data that        identify the specific underlying disease, RIPPER can greatly enhance the             diagnostic value of laboratory analysis.                                                                                                                                  n/a",RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS,6144004,F32LM000095,"['body fluids', ' classification', ' computer assisted instruction', ' programmed instruction', ' veterinary science']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS,F32,2000,52420,-0.008963394633924657
"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time. If the data         are supportive, these developments have the potential to significantly advance       the manner in which future diagnostic interviews are conducted with mental           health populations.                                                                                                                                                       n/a",ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT,6096946,R03MH060134,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' anxiety', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' child behavior disorders', ' child psychology', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' depression', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' model design /development', ' mood disorders', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2000,63589,-0.0007460718824391273
"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This proposed project has       three primary objectives. Objective 1 is to develop improved strategies for          fitting more accurate classification and regression tree (i.e., CART) models.        Objective 2 is to develop a formal framework to allow statistical inference on       tree models. Objective 3 is to develop and distribute public-domain software         that will allow applied data analysts to implement the methods we develop in         the first two objectives. To meet these objectives we will integrate                 statistical and computational machine learning approaches. We believe our work       can have a significant impact in biomedical data analysis by combining the           strengths of statistics for developing objective criteria for model selection        and for providing a framework for assessing and quantifying uncertainty              associated with a model, with the strengths of machine learning for fitting          models to large and complex datasets.                                                                                                                                     n/a",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES,6090912,R01GM061218,"['classification', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2000,214602,-0.017759866995280326
"INTERACTIVE MEDIA FOR WOMEN CONSIDERING HORMONE THERAPY The long-term goal of Phase I and Phase II is to create a series of bilingual (Spanish/English), bicultural, interactive CD-ROMs dealing with issues related to menopause and aging, with specific emphasis on Hispanic women. This proposal will result in a CD-ROM about Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) that takes 15-3O minutes to use and will test its value in a controlled study. Through an interactive decision-tree that specifies individual risk factors and lifestyle preferences, the CD-ROM will help users identify their options, including HRT, lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet, and other alternatives. Besides providing information, the CD-ROM will be designed to improve decision-making and increase women's confidence in their ability to make informed choices. Although it may increase the risk of cancer, HRT relieves short-term menopausal symptoms, and appears to offer long-term benefits of reduced risk for heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis. Over 40 million women will pass through menopause in the next two decades. Studies have shown that Hispanic women are less familiar with HRT and less likely to use it than non-Hispanic white women. In addition, Hispanas approach medical care with their own set of cultural values. Interactive media offer personalization, enhanced learning through multiple sensory input, and a cost-effective method of providing information in a managed care environment or busy individual practice. This is an innovative application of existing technology to provide patient education. Possible topics for Phase II include osteoporosis, heart disease, depression, and stroke. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Educational media is a $3B market. Print and video materials on HRT and menopause are available, but little exists as interactive media, in Spanish, and/or is culturally-relevant to Hispanics. This CD-ROM and related topics in Phase II can be sold to HMOs, clinics, and doctors' offices through direct sales; posted on the Internet; or distributed through medical media and pharmaceutical companies, medical associations, and Hispanic and/or women's groups.  n/a",INTERACTIVE MEDIA FOR WOMEN CONSIDERING HORMONE THERAPY,6229044,R43AG017016,"['DVD /CD ROM', ' Hispanic Americans', ' aging', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' education evaluation /planning', ' estrogens', ' female', ' health education', ' hormone therapy', ' interactive multimedia', ' menopause', ' progestins', "" women's health""]",NIA,SANDIA CONSULTING GROUP,R43,2000,9813,-0.04603307272443958
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10099785,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disclosure', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'court', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,429327,-0.010480966022671808
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,9952803,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2020,92359,-0.030258857055808407
"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,9907467,F30HL151074,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Triage', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'theories', 'time use', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2020,41178,-0.016764100268753714
"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10043768,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'structured data', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,253379,-0.033266622244758584
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9941090,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,605875,-0.0017766907614405105
"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10133362,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2020,358890,-0.023543125004101422
"Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points Project Summary Biomedical data science data modeling is relevant to a plethora of informatics research activities, such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. As Electronic Health Record systems become more advanced and more mature, with the potential to incorporate a wide and diverse array of data from genomics to mobile health (mHealth) applications, the scope and nature of the biomedical data science questions researchers ask become broader. Concomitantly, the answers to their questions have the potential to impact the care of millions of patients—getting the answers right, proactively, is high stakes. However, in data modeling currently, there is no bioethics framework to guide the process of mapping key decision points and recording the rationale for choices made. Making data modeling decision points, as well as the reasoning behind them, explicit would have a twofold impact on improving biomedical data science by: 1. Enhancing transparency and reproducibility and maximizing the value of data science research and 2. Supporting the ability to assess decision points and rationales in terms of their most crucial ethical ramifications. Research in this area is particularly timely amid the interest in, and enthusiasm for, leveraging Big Data sources in the service of improving patient population health and the health of the general public. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently released a strategic plan for data science; there is no better time than now to create an initial bioethical framework to inform common data modeling decision points. The improvements in data quality that will derive from decision point mapping and bioethical review will enhance efforts to apply data models across a range of high-impact areas, from predictive analytics to support clinical decision-making to robust trending models in population health to better inform local, regional, and national health policies and resource allocation. To develop this initial bioethics framework, we will use well- established qualitative research methods (interviews, focus groups, and in-person deliberation) to map the decision points in biomedical data modeling research and document the rationales invoked to support those decisions (Aim 1 key informant interviews); assess those data science decision points and decision-making rationales for their bioethical ramifications (Aim 2 focus groups); and create an initial bioethics data modeling framework (Aim 3 deliberative meeting). This study would be the first to provide a bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe. This approach directly supports core scientific values of inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and reproducibility that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global. Project Narrative This study would be the first to develop an initial bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe—not least because poorly developed data models have the potential to impact adversely the health of individuals, groups, and communities. Currently, there is limited conversation around potential bioethics issues in data modeling, and as yet no implementable guidance on how biomedical data science modeling research activities should occur. The initial ethics framework developed by this study would provide a roadmap to ensure that data modeling decision points are documented and their ethical ramifications considered at the outset of model creation, thus supporting core scientific values of inclusivity, accountability, reproducibility, and transparency that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global.",Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points,10039527,R21HG011277,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethical Review', 'Ethics', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'National Health Policy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'data tools', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'high standard', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'informant', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'model development', 'patient population', 'population health', 'programs', 'public trust', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NHGRI,"HASTINGS CENTER, INC.",R21,2020,100000,-0.03888297097102099
"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance.

"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,9992378,F31LM013403,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Ethnography', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Police', 'Policy Maker', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Service provision', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'court', 'deep learning', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health equity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'social', 'social bias', 'social inequality', 'symposium', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,50520,-0.020725351098972906

"A Machine Learning-Based Mobile Application and Cloud Platform to Enable Accurate and Streamlined Surveillance of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection and Schistosomiasis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis affect 2 billion people and have significant detrimental effects on health. Strategies to implement STH and schistosomiasis interventions currently rely on testing for these parasites by microscopic analysis of stool samples to detect parasite eggs and identify egg species. Accurate surveillance testing and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making at the programmatic level to implement infection control strategies. Approaches that increase the speed and standardize the accuracy of microscopy-based testing and streamline reporting could help eliminate STH infections and schistosomiasis. We propose to develop a mobile phone-based STH-schistosome egg identification and counting tool that employs machine learning (deep learning) and works in the absence of an internet connection. With this app, users will collect surveillance data for integration into a cloud platform. Surveillance data can then be visualized in dashboards to inform interventions to control disease. Our approach is fundamentally different from other published work that develop machine learning algorithms for STH and schistosomiasis because it will very accurately identify egg types during surveillance activities, and it will be available to users in an app and integrate with cloud storage and reporting. Our interdisciplinary team combines the expertise of global health researchers, product usability testing experts, microscopists, and data scientists. In the R21 phase, we will collect the largest ever microscopy image set of STH and schistosome eggs (> 15 000). We will train an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks that make highly accurate parasite egg classification (species identification) and embed this algorithm into a mobile app that works without internet connectivity. To promote app utility, we will evaluate its accuracy and usability in a surveillance setting. We established the feasibility of our approach in preliminary data by building a web app that serves the results of a deep learning model that identifies STH and schistosome eggs with > 98% accuracy. The R33 phase will be only undertaken if well-defined milestones are achieved. We will further develop the mobile app as a data capture system that will integrate with cloud storage and a dynamic data visualization system to enable increased accuracy in STH and schistosomiasis surveillance over time and across geographic location. ​Validation studies will assess the​ benefits of the system to time and cost savings and quality of data collected during surveillance activities. The overall goal of this work is to increase the accuracy and streamline STH and schistosomiasis surveillance to enable effective decision-making in disease control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate surveillance testing in the field and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making by soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and schistosomiasis control and prevention programs. This project will develop and test a mobile phone-based STH-schistosomiasis diagnostic system that employs machine learning to very accurately identify and count parasite eggs from microscopy images of stool samples.

"Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.  To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning, perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro- posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab- orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers. Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).  Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com- plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create predictive models for CRI.  In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi- ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications. Project Narrative During the perioperative period hemodynamic instability is the norm rather than the exception; the ability of clinicians to manage this instability has been associated with postoperative complications affecting more than 15 million Americans and costing more than $165 billion each year. There are no current risk scores that predict instability in real time, however the recent widespread adoption of electronic medical records and creation of genomic biobanks creates unique opportunities to develop scores that are both accurate and precise. We will use machine learning techniques to create risk scores for perioperative cardiorespiratory instability – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia – using combined electronic medical record, genomic and physiologic waveform data.","Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability",10055690,K01HL150318,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'California', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Latino', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'feeding', 'genetic information', 'genetic profiling', 'genomic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'multiple data sources', 'online course', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'structured data', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2020,175284,-0.02140782807673894
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy Project Summary/Abstract Artificial intelligence on genomic/healthcare data that is performed jointly between multiple collaborating institutions relies on a trust model but can accelerate genomic medicine research and facilitate quality improvement. To conduct such machine learning while protecting patient privacy and reducing security risks, we are developing blockchain-based privacy-preserving learning methods in a K99/R00 study supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). However, our previous design of privacy-preserving learning on private blockchain assumed “semi-honesty” as the underlying adversary assumption. That is, we assume that each participating site is curious yet very careful and honest, such that it would only submit correct predictive models. Nevertheless, in real world this assumption may be too optimistic; the models submitted could be an old one due to network latency or malicious users may try to create fake models, which can in turn lead to bioethical concerns and reduce the incentives for genomic/clinical institutions to participate in the collaborative predictive modeling. Therefore, the capability to detect, assess and prevent “model misconducts” is critical to increase the integrity/reliability of machine learning. To address this issue, we consider the following 3 types of model misconducts: (1) model plagiarism, of which a site becomes a free-rider and just submits a copy of a model from the other sites, trying to hide their own information and inspect models from other sites; (2) model fabrication, of which a site mocks up a model, trying to hide information and disturb the machine learning process; and (3) model falsification, of which a site tweaks its model a bit, trying to just disturb the learning process. For each type of the model misconducts, we are interest in how to detect these misconducts of another site, how to assess the losses of machine learning results due to misconducts, and how to prevent these model misconducts. Our aims include (a) detecting model misconducts using model properties, (b) assessing model misconducts losses via model simulation, and (c) preventing model misconducts based on whole model history. The innovative components to our proposed project include (i) summarizing various types of model misconduct, (ii) developing a complete strategy to handle the model misconduct, and (iii) providing a generalizable approach to mitigate bioethical concerns for collaborative machine learning. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence performed jointly between multiple collaborating institutions can accelerate genomic medicine research and facilitate quality improvement, but relies on a trust model which may be too optimistic in real-world setting. In this project, we plan to develop a comprehensive detection, assessment and prevention mechanism to address the potential bioethical risks brought by misconducts of model plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification. The proposed study can supplement the considerations of model misconducts for our original project of privacy-preserving learning on blockchain.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,10130868,R00HG009680,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioethics', 'Budgets', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Discrimination', 'Event', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Pattern', 'Plagiarism', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Site', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'base', 'blockchain', 'design', 'distributed ledger', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'models and simulation', 'patient privacy', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'statistics']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R00,2020,102049,-0.002972079972237237
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10068549,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,81310,-0.02773086791302946
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9921505,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'post-trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'support vector machine', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,245552,-0.016594166621492348
"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9868326,R01LM012973,"['Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,367184,-0.05456325702744145
"Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research Optimizing the Utility of Electronic Medical Records Data in  Data-driven Health Research ABSTRACT Medical centers continue to archive patient follow-up data in Electronic Medical Records (EMR), which have tremendous value in discovering new knowledge and insights. The large volume of EMR data can play an important role in improving the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models in healthcare, especially when misdiagnosis is known to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. Despite these merits, EMR data are invariably corrupted by factors like missing values, outliers, and unrealistic measurements, which prevent researchers from fully utilizing such abundant data in many important studies. Many studies simply discard a large number of samples to get rid of missingness and eventually bias their data-driven analytical models. Existing techniques for missing data imputation use simplified linear models and are mostly suitable for imputing cross-sectional data missingness that ignore longitudinal missingness in patient follow-up data. This proposal aims to investigate novel artificial intelligence (AI) based models to improve the quality and utility of EMR data in preparation for data-driven retrospective studies. Toward this preparation, the goal of the project is 1) to investigate more accurate and robust data imputation models compared to existing ones and 2) adapt state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in preparing optimal representation of large EMR data. The proposed research will 1) maximize the quality and utility of EMR data to support a multitude of retrospective studies, 2) enable visualization of complex patient data, 3) identify more important and predictive clinical parameters, 4) yield a compact and optimal representation of large EMR datasets. We hypothesize that optimally processed EMR data with state-of-the-art AI models can most accurately model patient risk when compared to existing statistical and clinical risk models. This project will combine the complementary expertise of the collaborators, Dr. Manar Samad, PhD (Computer Science), Dr. Owen Johnson, DPH (Biostatistics and Public Health), and Dr. Edilberto Raynes, MD, PhD (Medicine) along with the participating undergraduate students at Tennessee State University (TSU). The proposal entails several research and development components that will allow undergraduate students to gain valuable research and analytical skills in data science, programming, and health informatics. The project activities will expose health science students to AI-based computing solutions to broaden their scope of future health research and career. This project will help TSU prepare a strong workforce of minority students who will gain competitive skill sets in data science and health informatics that are currently high in demand almost everywhere. Overall, the project will develop a data-capable workforce to strengthen an interdisciplinary research capacity and collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health science at TSU. Project Narrative Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data are invariably corrupted by data missingness and data redundancy that limit their application in many valuable data-driven research studies aiming to achieve the goals of precision medicine. This project aims to develop a number of innovative computational frameworks that will optimally prepare and utilize EMR data to facilitate research studies with relevance to patient risk modeling, discovery of new health markers, and patient-specific prognosis and therapeutic strategy. The project will leverage recent advances in machine learning and data science by involving an interdisciplinary team of researchers consisting of three faculty members, two graduate students, and four undergraduate students, which will establish a data-centric research collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health Science.",Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research,10111205,R15LM013569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'complex data ', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'minority student', 'neural network', 'non-linear transformation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2020,421700,-0.027739422580290374
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death.

"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9884791,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,92070,-0.03914898191121488
"Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia ABSTRACT In this competitive revision, within the same scope of developing and deploying algorithms to make a quantum leap in clinical diagnosis as that in our current U01EB021183, we would like to revise the original aims to add a new Aim to leverage our expertise in the areas of algorithm development and clinical translation to make immediate contributions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we propose to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enable chest x-ray radiography (CXR) as an alternative diagnostic tool to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia, to rapidly triage patients for appropriate treatment, to monitor the treatment response in a contained environment, and to optimize the distribution of the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, our overarching objective is to develop automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 related pneumonia from other non-COVID-19 related pneumonia using CXR images.

"ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of Americans are in need of evidence-based counseling, such as motivational interviewing (MI), for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) each year. To develop competence in an evidence-based practice like MI, trainees require ample opportunities for practice and immediate, performance-based feedback on the skills that they are learning. However, this is challenging if not impossible to offer at scale -- to the large number of providers in need of training. Opportunities for practice typically rely on roleplays with other trainees with limited experience, and feedback requires either direct supervision from an expert trainer or behavioral coding from a trained coding team; these are costly, limited, and time consuming. AI-based technology can meet this need, generating many opportunities for practice, and providing regular, actionable feedback. Many practice opportunities coupled with rapid, performance-based feedback can enhance and expand training in evidence-based counseling for AUDs in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.  Lyssn.io​, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. ​Lyssn’s​ team includes expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous research demonstrated the basic utility of a prototype conversational agent (ClientBot) for training counselors. Currently, ClientBot simulates a general mental health client who can engage in open-ended interaction with trainees and provides immediate, performance-based feedback to trainees using machine learning.  The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal partners ​Lyssn​ with Prevention Research Institute (PRI), who has a long track-record of training counselors in evidence-based approaches for AUD and currently trains approximately 1,250 counselors per year. Phase I will adapt ClientBot to an AUD training context, including understanding PRI training workflows, assessing usability, and accuracy of machine learning based MI feedback. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a randomized training trial (N = 200 PRI trainees) to evaluate the effectiveness of ClientBot on learning of MI skills compared to a wait-list and PRI training-as-usual. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change underlying ClientBot’s MI skills training. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on role plays with peers and human judgment for training and performance-based feedback and support commercialization of a ClientBot product for training of AUD counselors in evidence-based practices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Training counselors in evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) requires repeated opportunities for skills practice with performance-based feedback, which is challenging to provide at scale. Building on an existing prototype, ​Lyssn.io​ – a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies – will enhance and evaluate an AI-based, conversational agent (ClientBot) that simulates a realistic client with alcohol concerns and provides performance-based feedback to support counselor training.",ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD,10009084,R44AA028463,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention Research', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Role', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Sports', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Vision', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'alcohol testing', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral health', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'peer', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIAAA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,397456,-0.04461704515436556
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10140938,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boston', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Patients&apos', ' Rooms', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Sum', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'Ventilator', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2020,210642,-0.030028045432638668
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9870948,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,420434,-0.032870097994017265
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9974350,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2020,459252,-0.024136677499751912
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Testing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contact Lenses', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Glass', 'Industrialization', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neural Retina', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'gene therapy', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoscale', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'restoration', 'scaffold', 'stem cell therapy', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'translational approach', 'vision science', 'wearable device']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,-0.01828735745280918
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",10018097,K01LM013257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Management', 'Information Systems', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care outcomes', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'computerized physician order entry', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health care delivery', 'health care service organization', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'long short term memory', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilayer perceptron', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized decision', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research facility', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'social health determinants', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2020,180368,-0.027021013134434457
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9882206,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2020,176541,-0.02433338940093427
"Improving Population Representativeness of the Inference from Non-Probability Sample Analysis SUMMARY The critical role of population-representativeness for estimating disease incidence and prevalence has been widely accepted in epidemiologic studies. Improving population representativeness of nonprobability samples, such as samples of volunteers in epidemiologic studies or electronic health records, however, has received little attention by biostatisticians or epidemiologists. In this project, we propose two innovative “pseudoweight” construction methods: 1) two-step matching, and 2) calibration, under an adapted exchangeability assumption, for unbiased estimation of disease incidence and prevalence in the target population. The proposed methods, combined with machine learning methods for propensity score estimation, will achieve significant bias reduction, especially when selection into nonprobability samples is driven by complex relationships between the covariates. We will quantify the bias reduced by the proposed “pseudoweights”, numerically and empirically, on the estimation of disease incidence and prevalence in the target population. Monte Carlo simulation studies are designed under varying degrees of departure from the adapted exchangeability assumption to evaluate the bias of the proposed estimates. The robustness of the proposed estimators against varying sample sizes, number of clusters in survey, and complexities of the true propensity score modeling will be investigated in scenarios that differ by levels of non-linearity, non-additivity and correlations between covariates in the true propensity model. Using data from National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP, a nonprobability cohort sample) data and the US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, a probability survey sample), the proposed methods will be applied to estimate the prevalence of self-reported diseases and all-cause or all-cancer mortality rates for people aged 50-71 in the US. To test our methods, we will purposely select outcome variables that are available in both the NIH-AARP and the NHIS. Thus, the amount of bias in NIH-AARP estimates corrected by the proposed pseudoweights can be quantified in practice, assuming the weighted NHIS estimate is true. The proposed methods, although motivated by the volunteer-based epidemiological studies, have wide applications outside of epidemiology, such as electronic health records or web surveys. The results from this project can be used by epidemiologists and health policy makers to improve the understanding of the health-related characteristics in the general population. Computer software that implements the proposed methods will be made available for public use.

"Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication,10111658,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data standards', 'data streams', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT FAYETTEVILLE,R01,2020,491992,-0.0372138061158953
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations.

"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency.

"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,9895943,R34MH119411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Mental Health Centers', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personnel Turnover', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Management', 'Predictive Factor', 'Productivity', 'Professional Burnout', 'Psyche structure', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental health organization', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'rural area', 'structured data', 'theories', 'treatment services', 'urban area']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2020,244635,-0.01782901750990694
"Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution Project Summary/Abstract It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.! Project Narrative This proposal will provide a system for the scalable continuous evolution and computational design of antibodies against user-selected antigens. Antibodies are critical tools in medical research and are the basis for numerous therapies, but the generation of custom antibodies against new targets is a difficult and specialized task. The system proposed will turn antibody generation into a routine and widely accessible process for researchers in almost any field.","Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution",10021311,R01CA260415,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biogenic Amine Receptors', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cultured Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detergents', 'Diagnostic', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epinephrine', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybridomas', 'Image', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Western Blotting', 'Yeasts', 'addiction', 'antibody engineering', 'antibody libraries', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'decision research', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanobodies', 'new technology', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural biology', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,1690552,-0.0307026047924393
"A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand PROJECT SUMMARY Restoring hand function remains an elusive goal for many clinical conditions, including stroke, osteoarthritis, tetraplegia, amputation, and traumatic injury. The hand’s anatomical complexity makes restoring hand function particularly challenging because altering any one parameter in the hand can have cascading effects that are difficult to predict, but essential to control. In this proposal, as a critical step toward informing personalized treatments for the hand, we will study how subject-specific differences influence hand function. Completion of this proposal will rely on collection of three datasets that are designed to provide varying levels of biomechanical detail and require varying levels of effort to collect. Briefly, these datasets include (1) a simulation dataset containing 500,000 simulations fully describing all musculoskeletal parameters involved in hand force production, (2) a dense, biomechanical datasets that describes the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity required for hand force production in 30 adults, and (3) a sparse, clinically-inspired dataset that describes demographics, anthropometrics, and clinical metrics of hand function in 1000 adults. In Aim 1, we will leverage the first two datasets to design a data-driven analysis framework that identifies the most important biomechanical parameter(s) and maps how those parameters influence hand force production. Completion of this aim will elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms that modulate hand force production and evaluate the ability to use simulation data, instead of experimental data, to identify these mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will leverage all three datasets to create a transfer learning framework capable of efficiently and accurately predicting subject-specific muscle force-generating parameters from easy to collect clinical data. We specifically focus on muscle force- generating parameters because these parameters remain challenging to quickly and accurately estimate, are known to vary across the population, and are highly related to functional metrics like strength. Completion of this aim will provide a new approach for rapidly estimating subject-specific musculoskeletal parameters, thereby enabling efficient creation of subject-specific models and potentially catalyzing use of such models in a clinical setting. Overall, the results from this study could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to understand the biomechanical mechanisms underlying force production in the hand. Specifically, we utilize machine learning methods to examine how subject-specific differences influence hand force production and create subject-specific computer models from easy to obtain clinical data. The results, which integrate modeling with an individual’s clinical data, could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments.",A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand,10040078,R21EB030068,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diagnostic', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand Strength', 'Hand functions', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Production', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'bone', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hand rehabilitation', 'individual patient', 'kinematics', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'neural network', 'neuromuscular', 'novel strategies', 'open-access repositories', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,560939,-0.01840772695531505
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life. The proposed research provides important methodological advances for extracting these insights from widely available patient health records.",Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records,9936444,K99LM012926,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cluster computing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient health information', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2020,89401,-0.029140470649145257
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10118580,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248966,-0.020974886109651876
"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10047364,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,241500,-0.036177082914948075
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10136941,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2020,746725,-0.04128537018224855
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",9946212,R01AI151176,"['Absenteeism', 'Address', 'African', 'Age', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease model', 'Ebola', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'austin', 'base', 'cofactor', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'diverse data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory virus', 'school district', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographic group', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,611043,-0.010111310809311784
"DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based data analytics and cloud computing platform, paired with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared wearable devices, to create a personalized baseline index that could indicate a change in health status for patients who have tested COVID-19 positive.  The project involves the development and validation of a COVID-19 Decompensation Index (CDI) that builds off physIQ’s existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics platform.  Data will be collected from 400 human subjects that are both pre-hospitalization subjects (found to be positive for COVID-19) and subjects that have been hospitalized and treated for COVID and then discharged.  This combined population will consist of COVID-19 decompensation cases (event cases) and cases for which COVID-19 did not result in any kind of decompensation (non-event cases).  The 400-patient dataset will be partitioned into a training subset and a testing subset.  Performance will be assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) as the metric of performance.

"Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1 PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies showed discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indians (AI) population and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations when studying AI population due to the small sample sizes for AI population. Data collected by AI Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) provides an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AI population due to sufficient sample size and extensive information. However, most surveys conducted by TECs used non-probability sampling design (e.g. convenient sample) due to its lower cost and increased time efficiency. Non-probability sample may suffer from sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors without further proper adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hampers the analysis of AI population in health and behavior research. Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability samples can reduce sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors in original non-probability sample. The Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research. During the past years, we have 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 3) assembled an experienced team of multi-disciplinary team of experts. In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a data integration approach using machine learning and propensity score modeling We will develop machine learning and propensity score based data integration approaches to combine information from non-probability and probability samples. Compared to existing methods (i.e., Calibration, Parametric approach), our proposed approaches are more robust against the failure of underlying model assumptions. The inference is more general and multi-purpose (e.g. one can estimate most parameters such as means, totals and percentiles). Simulation studies will be performed to compare our proposed methods with other existing methods. A computing package will be built to implement the method in other settings. Aim 2. Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in AI health and behavior research We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data source and expands the impact of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability sample, which can provide in-depth understanding regarding the AI population health and behavior studies. Project Narrative The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop an accurate, robust and multi-purpose data integration methodology for AI population (non-probability sample) analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research such as diabetes and smoking. The code implementing the proposed method will be released and is general enough to be applied to AI population studies of other fileds. The success of this study will vertically advance the field by facilitating the AI population analysis, which can provide a better guidance and new insights on the future precision personalized prevention and treatment of certain diseases.",Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1,10063407,R21MD014658,"['Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Calibration', 'Censuses', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic state', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Fairs', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Kansas', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oklahoma', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Probability Samples', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States Indian Health Service', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cigarette smoking', 'cluster computing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'simulation', 'smoking prevalence', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tribal health']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R21,2020,115176,-0.01613701775843462
"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD.

"Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging” annual meetings to be offered each September from 2020 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting builds on its very successful first instance in 2019 and will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen over the last four months represents a nearly unprecedented challenge for the infectious disease modelling community. This pandemic has benefitted from huge volumes of data being generated, but the rate of dissemination of these data has often outpaced existing data pipelines. While the last decade has seen significant advances in real-time infectious disease forecasting — spurred by rapid growth in data and computational methods — these methods have primarily focused on seasonal endemic diseases based, are based on historical data, and so do not apply easily to this novel pathogen, or to pandemic scenarios. New methods are needed to leverage the wealth of surveillance data at fine spatial granularity, together with associated information about policy interventions and environmental conditions over space and time, to reason directly about the mechanisms to forecast and understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These methods must use sound statistical and epidemiological principles and be flexible and computationally efficient to provide real- time forecasts to guide public health decision-making and respond to changing aspects of this global crisis. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop scalable, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical compartmental models to flexibly respond to state-level public health forecasting needs, and (2) to design models and conduct analyses to draw robust inference about the effectiveness of interventions in impacting the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the US to build an evidence-base for continued responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an emerging public health crisis. A fundamental challenge is how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about managing resources, improving health outcomes, and controlling further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Real-time forecasting and flexible mechanistic models to understand the disease dynamics can provide policy-makers tools to manage public response. The goal of the proposed research is to adapt existing statistical modeling frameworks and develop new ones for making forecasts of COVID-19 in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios,10150377,R35GM119582,"['2019-nCoV', 'Award', 'Budgets', 'COVID-19', 'Calibration', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Fever', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza prevention', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data pipeline', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'influenza epidemic', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid growth', 'real world application', 'reproductive', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2020,78507,-0.004198507310412322
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8.

"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance",VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers,9987201,R44ES029348,"['Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioterrorism', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hazardous Substances', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Police', 'Psychometrics', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'effectiveness measure', 'emergency service responder', 'first responder', 'hazardous materials disaster', 'improved', 'novel', 'skills']",NIEHS,"TIETRONIX SOFTWARE, INC.",R44,2020,199977,-0.0114744758997222
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults Approximately 3 million young adults aged 18-44 years currently have diabetes in the United States. This number is projected to increase to ~5.8 million by 2060. Differentiating diabetes types is crucial, because the etiology, treatments, and outcomes of diabetes differ substantially by type. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for ~17% and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ~75% of total diabetes in US young adults. This distribution of diabetes types continuously evolves. We do not have a large-scale surveillance system to monitor the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The widespread use and increasing functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems substantially increase the quantity, breadth, and timeliness of data available for surveillance and reduce costs compared with population-based registries and surveys. EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~6 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adults from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US young adults with those in young adults from other countries and regions. This study is innovative, because it will detect a false negative rate as low as 0.2%, leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. This study will advance our understanding of the age, sex, racial/ethnic, and geographic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The obtained surveillance data will inform planning for healthcare needs, prioritize the allocation of healthcare resources, and reduce health disparities via identifying and prioritizing subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities. The burden of diabetes has been increasing considerably in recent decades in US young adults. However, there is no large-scale surveillance system for monitoring the burden of diabetes by type in US young adults. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and temporal trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US young adults according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults,10085448,U18DP006502,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,-0.056641379541197766
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,9979523,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,77243,-0.048409475127424044
"A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations SUMMARY As a result of recent and rapid advances of immunogenetical, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies, the accuracy and efficiency of donor-recipient immunogenetical matching are expected to be significantly improved. As such, traditional tissue banking practices are being severely challenged due to low cryopreservation throughput. Skin allograft transplantations are currently utilized for numerous clinical applications. In such applications, donor tissues are now typically utilized as “expensive bandages”, i.e. for temporary coverage, thereby requiring painful and damaging follow-on autotransplantation procedures. With tremendously improved skin graft cryopreservation methods coupled with use of HLA matching based on AI network, future tissue banking platforms can potentially provide grafts to be used as permanent and definitive treatment for patients, thereby bringing high impact to clinical applications and the healthcare industry. Based on CryoCrate’s novel ultra-fast (106 K/min on a sample surface) cooling technology platform (PCT/US2019/26162), this project aims to develop a highly efficient (approaching 100% post-thaw viability) tissue graft cryopreservation prototype system that requires no cryoprotectant. The post-thaw viability and functionality will be assessed by standard in vitro assays using porcine and human skin (research exempt) grafts and in vivo assays using a mouse model. After achieving these aims, in future phase II and III stages, CryoCrate and its academic collaborator will collaborate with a local Organ Procurement Organization (Mid-America Transplant) and a wound healing clinic (University of Missouri Hospital) for porcine and human skin transplantation studies and clinical trials. Narrative A novel skin graft cryopreservation technology that requires no cryoprotectant will be developed to significantly improve efficiencies for tissue banking and allograft transplantation practices. This project initiates collaboration between CryoCrate LLC and local stakeholders, and thereby paves a path to commercialization of a new generation of ultra‐fast tissue cryopreservation devices.",A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations,10011745,R43AI155070,"['Allografting', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Bandage', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cryopreserved Tissue', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Freeze Drying', 'Freezing', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunogenetics', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'In Vitro', 'Liquid substance', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Skin graft', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'skin allograft', 'success', 'transplant model', 'two-dimensional', 'wound healing']",NIAID,"CRYOCRATE, LLC",R43,2020,160371,-0.018449980582704997
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9891936,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2020,130228,-0.016164911172680572

"Multi-Study Integer Programming Methods for Human Voltammery Project Summary/Abstract  The development of treatments for addiction requires the characterization of neural mechanisms underlying reward. Studying reward in humans requires assays that can detect changes in neurotransmitter levels with high chemical specificity. Recently, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) has been implemented in humans to measure dopamine with high temporal and spatial resolution. This technological achievement was enabled in large part through the novel application of machine learning methods. FSCV relies on statistical tools since FSCV records an electrochemical response which must be converted into concentration estimates via a statistical model. The validity of the scientific conclusions from human FSCV studies therefore depends heavily on the reliability of these statistical models to generate accurate dopamine concentration estimates.  In human FSCV, models are fit on in vitro training sets as making in vivo training sets in humans is infeasible. Producing accurate estimates thus requires that models trained on in vitro training sets generalize to in vivo brain recordings. Combining data from multiple training sets is the standard approach human FSCV researchers have employed to improve model generalizability. This proposal extends work that shows that multi-study machine learning methods improve dopamine concentration estimates by combining training sets from different electrodes such that the resulting average signal (“cyclic voltammogram” or CV) is similar to the average CV of the electrode used in the brain. However, this approach relies on random resampling. This is problematic because the randomness limits the extent to which estimate accuracy can be improved and the slow speed of the resampling approach precludes the generation of estimates during data collection, which is critical to experiment success.  This proposal details the development of methods that leverage mixed integer programming to optimally generate training sets that combine data from multiple electrodes. By generating training sets that are specifically tailored to the electrode used for brain measurements, one can vastly improve dopamine concentration estimate accuracy. The speed of the integer programming methods will enable the use of this approach during data collection. This work will include validation of the methods on in vitro data as well as on data from published in vivo and slice experiments in rodents. By applying methods to published optogenetic experiments, one can compare estimates from the proposed methods and from standard methods. The asymptotic properties of the proposed methods will be characterized analytically assuming a linear mixed effects model and empirically through application of the methods to data simulated under this model.  This work will be conducted at the highly collaborative and innovative Harvard School of Public Health. The fellowship will support growth in statistical, computing and collaborative skills, and prepare the trainee for a productive career as a biostatistics professor who develops methods for neuroscience and addiction research. Project Narrative  Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in humans offers an invaluable tool to study the neural mechanisms underlying reward by allowing for sub-second detection of dopamine during cognitive-behavioral tasks. However, conducting voltammetry in humans presents distinct statistical challenges that must be overcome to ensure optimal dopamine concentration estimates. We propose novel statistical methods that use mixed integer optimization and extend preliminary work that shows multi-study machine learning methods substantially improve dopamine concentration estimate accuracy.",Multi-Study Integer Programming Methods for Human Voltammery,10067624,F31DA052153,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Property', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'algorithm training', 'career', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'multiple data sources', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIDA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2020,37235,-0.023371820357627575

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10024094,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,422740,-0.021860950073142087
"Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance (GaCTSA) EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF TEST CENTERS FOR COVID-19 USING MACHINE LEARNING AND  ADAPTIVE SAMPLING ABSTRACT A critical task in managing and dealing with COVID-19 in communities is to perform diagnostic and/or antibody tests to identify diseased individuals. This information is critical to public health officials to estimate prevalence and transmission, and to effectively plan for required resources such as ICU beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and medical staff. Additionally, information on the number of infected people can be used to develop probabilistic and statistical models to estimate the reproduction number of the disease, and to predict the likely spatial and temporal trajectories of the outbreak. This provides vital information for planning actions and preparing policies and guidelines for social-distancing, school closures, remote work, community lockdown, etc. Despite the importance of diagnostic testing and identification of the positive cases, broad-scale testing is a challenging task particularly due to the limited number of test kits and resources. Our proposed research focuses on the development machine learning-based allocation strategies for determining the optimal location of COVID-19 test centers, including mobile and satellite centers, to minimize the local and global prediction uncertainties, maximize geographic coverage, associated with projections of spatio-temporal outbreak trajectories, and to improve efficient identification of diseased cases. EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF TEST CENTERS FOR COVID-19 USING MACHINE LEARNING AND  ADAPTIVE SAMPLING NARRATIVE Diagnostic and antibody tests for COVID-19 can provide invaluable information on prevalence and transmission of the disease. However, due to limited test capacity, broad-scale testing is currently not feasible. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a systematic and data-driven approach to defining testing strategies, in particular, determining the number and location of satellite and mobile testing centers (e.g., drive-through test locations). Our research program develops machine learning approaches to effectively allocate test centers for COVID-19 at the city, county, and state levels to accurately and reliably estimate the disease prevalence and its trajectory for resource planning and policy making, and to efficiently identify cases for treatment.",Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance (GaCTSA),10158891,UL1TR002378,"['Active Learning', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Biology', 'COVID-19', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Federal Government', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'disease transmission', 'environmental justice', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'transmission process']",NCATS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UL1,2020,225579,0.0011269535409410712
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",10018507,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,192195,-0.029658834019952098
"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,10018015,R01HS027363,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498859,-0.024587580457584725
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10133883,K01AI141616,"['Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'disorder control', 'malaria transmission', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,48885,-0.011157350375942784
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data.

"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",9948579,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,146578,-0.011157350375942784
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9935960,R00MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized controlled design', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248999,-0.01101941432158833
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9984252,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Models', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella aerogenes', 'Klebsiella oxytoca', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'acute care', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'budget impact', 'cost', 'data mining', 'economic evaluation', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial genomics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,728162,-0.01357322594240764
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"N3C & All of Us Research Program Collaborative Project Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented clinical and public health challenges. Though institutions collect large amounts of clinical data about COVID-19 cases, these datasets individually might not be diverse enough to draw population level conclusions. Also, statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. To tackle this problem, NCATS introduced the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science, community-based initiative to share patient level data for analysis. The initiative requires participating institutions to share information about their COVID-19 patients in a standard-driven way, including demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and other treatments. The data from multiple institutions will be merged and consolidated, and access will be provided to investigators through a centralized analytical platform. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with other NIH sponsored data sharing programs, such as the All of Us Research Program (AoURP). This administrative supplement will support efforts to clean and standardize data at VCU, and to transfer it to the N3C data repository. The supplement will also assist in introducing new services at the Wright Center to support our investigators to use the N3C resources. It will also enable collaboration with the AoURP by establishing a pipeline to collect and transmit consented patients' EHR data and by building on existing community outreach pathways to recruit additional participants for the AoURP. The project will be overseen by the PI/Executive Committee and supervised by the Director of Research Informatics. Procedures and services developed at our local CTSA hub will be shared and disseminated to the CTSA network. Project Narrative NIH/NCATS has been working on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which aims to build a centralized national data resource to be used by the research community to study the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential treatments as the pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative also offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with the All of Us Research Program (AoURP).

"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,-0.01937855739944335
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,10000112,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,365601,-0.0133415855787959
"A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth This project provides a data science framework and a toolbox of best practices for systematic and reproducible data-driven methods for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. Despite recent advances in methods for data-driven constructs, results are often hard to reproduce using samples from other studies. There is a lack of systematic statistical methods and analytical design for enhancing reproducibility. To fill this gap, we will develop a data science framework, including novel scalable algorithms and software, to derive and validate RDoC constructs. Although the proposed methods will generally apply to all RDoC domains and constructs, we focus specifically on furthering understanding of the RDoC domains of cognitive control (CC) and attention (ATT) constructs implicated in attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our application will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical/self-report data from large, nationally representative samples from the on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and multiple local clinical samples with ADHD and OCD. Specifically, using the baseline ABCD samples, in aim 1, we will apply and develop methods to assess and validate the current configuration of RDoC for CC and ATT using confirmatory latent variable modeling. We will implement and develop new unsupervised learning methods to construct new computational-driven, brain-based domains from multi-modal image data. In Aim 2, We will introduce network analysis (via Gaussian graphical models) to characterize heterogeneity in the interrelationship of RDoC measurements due to observed characteristics (i.e., age and sex). We will further model the heterogeneity of the population due to unobserved characteristics by introducing the data-driven precision phenotypes, which are the subgroup of participants with similar RDoC dimensions. We propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Generative Model and scalable algorithm for simultaneous dimension reduction and identify precision phenotypes. The model also serves as a tool to transfer information from the community sample ABCD to local clinical enriched studies. In aim 3, we will utilize the follow-up samples from ABCD and local clinical enriched data sets to validate the results from Aims 1 and 2 and assess the clinical utility of the precision phenotypes in predicting psychological development in follow-up time. Our project will provide a suite of analytical tools to validate existing RDoC constructs and derive new, reproducible constructs by accounting for various sources of heterogeneity. To advance the understanding of psychopathology using dimensional constructs of measurements from multiple units of analysis, we propose reproducible statistical framework for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. We will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical/self-report data from multiple samples to develop this framework. The design of our study consists of analyzing large, nationally representative samples, validating the results in local clinically enriched samples, and transfer information from the large community samples to local clinical samples.",A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth,10058921,R01MH124106,"['11 year old', 'Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychopathology', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'analytical tool', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biological sex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,710101,-0.023552349824688398

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option. This proposal will investigate and implement standards based approaches for computable phenotype identification from multiple EHRs.",National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms,10021669,R01GM105688,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Flowcharts', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'authority', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'computable phenotypes', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'database query', 'deep learning', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics training', 'information model', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'structured data', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,706851,-0.020231022672316492
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary:  Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has created a major public health crisis around the world. The novel coronavirus was observed to have a long incubation period and extremely infectious during this period. No proven effective treatment or vaccine is available. Massive public interventions have been implemented in many countries and states in the United States (US) at different phases of the outbreak with varying combinations of social dis- tancing, mobility restriction and population behavioral change. Decisions on how to implement these interventions (e.g., when to impose and relax mitigation measures) rely on important statistics of COVID epidemiology (e.g., effective reproduction number) that characterize and predict the course of COVID-19 outbreak. However, there is a lack of robust and parsimonious model of COVID epidemic that can accurately reﬂect the heterogeneity between susceptible populations and regions (e.g., demographics, healthcare capacity, social and economic determinants). There is no rigorous study to guide precision public health interventions that are tailored to a population or region depending on their characteristics. Furthermore, due to the non-randomized nature of public health interventions, it is critical to account for biases and confounding when comparing mitigation measures of COVID-19 across re- gions. To address these challenges, this project develops robust and generalizable analytic methods to evaluate public health interventions and assess individual patient risks of COVID-19 infection and complications. In Aim 1, we will develop dynamic and robust statistical models to predict the disease epidemic. The models will estimate the date of the ﬁrst unknown infection case, instantaneous effective reproduction number, and account for the incu- bation period of COVID-19 virus. Furthermore, heterogeneity in population's demographics, social and economic indicators, healthcare capacity and geographic locations will be incorporated to reﬂect their impacts on COVID epidemic. Under a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we will provide valid inference for comparing public health interventions implemented at different regions while accounting for confounding bias. Multiple sources of data from different states in the US will be analyzed to empirically test which states' response strategies are more effective and in which subpopulation. In Aim 2, we will focus on developing precise risk assessment tool of individ- ual COVID-19 patients using electronic health records (EHRs) collected at New York Presbyterian hospital in New York City, an epicenter of COVID-19. We will engineer features of patient's pre-conditions associated with severe COVID complications, recovery, or death. More importantly, we will engineer features that represent proxies of virus exposures from patients' geographic information. We will use machine learning techniques to create quantitative summaries of patient prognosis (e.g., transitioning to serious clinical stages, discharge, death). We will use inter- nal cross-validation and external calibration to validate developed algorithms. The project will generate evidence to guide precision public health intervention, optimal patient care, and efﬁcient healthcare resource allocation in anticipation of a second wave of COVID epidemic and in preparation of other infectious disease outbreaks. Project Narrative:  This project aims to develop robust and generalizable analytics to evaluate public health interventions in response to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess individual patient risks using multiple sources of data (e.g., ofﬁcial reports of COVID cases, electronic health records).

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium.

"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10017817,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,549226,-0.02439726630536739

"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots,9887876,R01GM109718,"['Affect', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral Model', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic outcome', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'health organization', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'provider networks', 'public health intervention', 'social', 'social media', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,324178,-0.02099968779302595
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9924432,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,298890,-0.010395903683584876
"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases.

"Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine A fundamental challenge in precision medicine is to understand the patterns of differentiation between individuals. To address this challenge, we propose to go beyond the traditional `one disease--one model' view of bioinformatics and pursue a new view built upon personalized patient models that facilitates precision medicine by leveraging both commonalities within a patient cohort as well as signatures unique to every individual patient. With the emergence of large-scale databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which collect multi-omic data on many different diseases, a new “pan-omics” and “pan-disease” paradigm has emerged to jointly analyze all patients in a disease cohort while accounting for patient-specific effects. An example of this is the recently released Pan-Cancer Atlas. At the same time, next generation statistical tools to accurately and rigorously draw the necessary inferences are lacking. In this project we propose a series of mathematically rigorous, statistically sound, and computationally feasible approaches to infer sample-specific models, providing a more complete view of heterogeneous datasets. By bringing together ideas from the machine learning, statistics, and mathematical optimization communities, we provide a rigorous framework for precision medicine via sample-specific statistical models. Crucially, we propose to analyze this framework and prove strong theoretical guarantees under weak assumptions--this dramatically distinguishes our framework from much of the existing literature. Towards these goals, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Discovery of new molecular profiles with sample-specific statistical models. We propose a general framework for inferring sample-specific models with low-rank structure based on the novel concept of distance-matching. This allows us to infer statistical models at the level of a single patient without overfitting, and is general enough to be applied for prediction, classification, and network inference as well as a variety of diseases and phenotypes. Aim 2: Multimodal approaches to personalized diagnosis--contextually interpretable models for actionable clinical decision support. In order to translate these models into practice, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model that supports complex, multimodal data types such as images and text combined with high-level interpretable features such as SNP data, gender, age, etc. This framework simultaneously boosts the accuracy of clinical predictions by exploiting sample heterogeneity while providing human-digestable explanations for the predictions being made. Aim 3: Next-generation precision medicine--algorithms and software for personalized estimation. To put our models into practical use, we will develop new algorithms for interpretable prediction of personalized clinical outcomes and visualization of personalized statistical models. All of our tools will be combined into a user-friendly software package called PrecisionX that will be freely available to researchers and clinicians everywhere. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Personalization with data is a critical challenge whenever decisions must be made at scale, and has applications that go beyond precision medicine; businesses, educational institutions, and financial institutions are among the many players that have acknowledged a stake in this complex problem. We expect the proposed work to provide a rigorous foundation for personalization with large and high-dimensional datasets, finding use throughout the broader scientific community as well as with industry and educational institutions. Alongside our collaboration with Pitt/UPMC, we will work with physicians and data scientists for practical feedback as well as provide training in the methods developed. n/a",Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine,10133782,R01GM140467,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Portraits', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'individual patient', 'large-scale database', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,305566,-0.02530883564820587
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,9920211,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,709525,-0.007767256966637297
"Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention PROJECT ABSTRACT  In the U.S., from 2011 to 2014, 7,208 maternal fatalities, with the trend worsening year-on-year (CDC, 2016). In addition to the 700+ fatalities, at least 50,000 woman experienced life-threatening complications, annually. According to CDC (2019) for every fatality, 70 more women suffer avoidable, traumatic complications as a result of pregnancy.  Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc, propose the evaluation of a cardiac risk assessment tool for pregnant and postpartum women; this tool updates automatically directly from patient medical records; wearable devices; and patient surveys. Success implies disruptive improvement in women's health. Proposed research involves three key elements: technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDOH) using geospatial mapping of patient locations. Technology: Study technology shall be based on the Invaryant Health Platform (IHP), a technology that automatically ingests data, from medical records, wearable devices, and other sources using proprietary AI based interoperability technology called Mesh-Complex Method Exchange (Mesh-CMX). We propose using the IHP in conjunction with novel prototype-level technology, namely Healthy Outcomes for all Pregnancy Experiences-Cardiovascular-risk Assessment Technology (HOPE-CAT) and the Invaryant machine learning technologies to monitor the patient, based on signals, out-of-range “trip-wires”, and trends in the mother's health data that merit medical intervention. By extending the proof of concept into an early commercial version of the software, and integrating it to the IHP which will automatically update changes in the patient's medical record, we will provide an “early warning” system for mothers and their providers. Data: The study will be tested on patients' medical records using the MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 Million unique patients. The tool will subsequently have the potential to be leveraged to over 90 million medical records for the MedStar and Cerner hospital systems, distilled down to meet specific eligibility criteria including, gender, age, race, pregnancy and medical outcomes. A second phase of this project would take the findings from the retrospective study (this grant request) and use the technology within the Medstar hospital system, to validate the efficacy of the findings in a “real-world setting”. Using our proprietary AI technology, we will compare each mother's progress against a cohort of retrospective data to enhance diagnostics and provide real-time feedback to caregivers and patients. Geospatial mapping: Mapping the patient medical record and the health information to their social setting is vital for understanding the underlying social constructs that affect the health of mothers in different regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc. propose the evaluation of a cardiovascular risk assessment tool (HOPE-CAT) for pregnant and postpartum women utilizing technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDoH) with geospatial mapping. HOPE- CAT, in conjunction with Invaryant's health platform and machine learning technologies, will monitor the patient based on signals, out-of-range ""trip-wires"", and trends in health data. HOPE-CAT will be validated on patient medical records using MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 million unique patients.","Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention",10200448,UL1TR001409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eclampsia', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Gender', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Experience', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Population', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'data ingestion', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health data', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'personalized intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'venous thromboembolism', 'wearable device']",NCATS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,UL1,2020,146537,-0.03135367056425371
"The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives – first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research “Beyond Our Borders,” we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is to accelerate translational science through programs to develop the translational workforce, promote the engagement of community members and other stakeholders, to promote research integration across the lifespan, and to catalyze innovative clinical and translational research. The ongoing development of collaborative data-based infrastructure and services is a central tenant to achieving this mission. The goals of this proposal are: for Iowa to join the N3C partnership, contributing data in an effective method that evolves and improves over time, to enable Iowa researchers to leverage the N3C data resource in their research and to leverage the N3C framework for other areas of research in the future.",The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award,10201104,UL1TR002537,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family Physicians', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Rural Population', 'School Nursing', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfer Agreement', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'community organizations', 'coronavirus disease', 'data acquisition', 'data enclave', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'rurality', 'social determinants', 'support tools', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UL1,2020,98933,-0.013890938555414095
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10005116,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2020,1316550,-0.017868938375790122
"Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks ABSTRACT Electronic health record (EHR) databases collect data that reflect routine clinical care. These databases are increasingly used in comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, quality improvement assessment, and public health surveillance to generate actionable evidence that improves patient care. It is often necessary to analyze multiple databases that cover large and diverse populations to improve the statistical power of the study or generalizability of the findings. A common approach to analyzing multiple databases is the use of a distributed research network (DRN) architecture, in which data remains under the physical control of data partners. Although EHRs are generally thought to contain rich clinical information, the information is not uniformly collected. Certain information is available only for some patients, and only at some time points for a given patient. There are generally two types of missing information in EHRs. The first is the conventionally understood and obvious missing data in which some data fields (e.g., body mass index) are not complete for various reasons, e.g., the clinician does not collect the information or the patient chooses not to provide the information. The second is less obvious because the data field is not empty but the recorded value may be incorrect due to missing data. For example, EHRs generally do not have complete data for care that occurs in a different delivery system. A medical condition (e.g., asthma) may be coded as “no” but the true value would have been “yes” if more complete data had been available, e.g., from claims data as the other delivery system would submit a claim to the patient’s health plan for the care provided. In other words, one may incorrectly treat “absence of evidence” as “evidence of absence”. EHRs hold great promise but we must address several outstanding methodological challenges inherent in the databases, specifically missing data. Addressing missing data is more challenging in DRNs due to different missing data mechanisms across databases. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Apply and assess missing data methods developed in single-database settings to handle obvious and well-recognized missing data in DRNs; (2) Apply and assess machine learning and predictive modeling techniques to address less obvious and under-recognized missing data for select variables in DRNs; and (3) Apply and assess a comprehensive analytic approach that combines conventional missing data methods and machine learning techniques to address missing data in DRNs. The analytic methods developed in this project, including the extension of existing missing data methods to DRNs, the innovative use of machine learning techniques to address missing data, and their integration with privacy- protecting analytic methods, will have direct impact on the design and analysis of future comparative effectiveness and safety studies, and patient-centered outcomes research conducted in DRNs.

"FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal we plan to contribute addressing the above foundational and operational challenges by advancing the science of influenza modeling and contributing novel methods and data sources that will increase the accuracy and availability of seasonal and pandemic influenza models. To address these challenges, we plan to build on the unique mechanistic spatially structured modeling approaches developed by our consortium, that includes stochastic metapopulation models and fully developed agent-based models nested together in our global epidemic and mobility modeling (GLEAM) approach. The objective of this project is to generate novel and actionable scientific insights from dynamic transmission models of influenza transmission that effectively integrate key socio-demographic indicators of the focus population, as well as a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our proposed work in specific aim 1 (A1) will leverage our global modeling (from the global to local scale) framework that can be used to explore the multi-year impact of influenza vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis/treatment, and community mitigation during influenza seasons and pandemics. Our specific aim 2 (A2) will focus on using high quality data to model heterogeneous transmission drivers and novel contact pattern stratifications that will allow us to guide mitigation strategies and prioritization for interventions. In our Aim 3 (A3) we will use artificial intelligence approaches to identify interventions that are particularly synergistic and well-suited to particular epidemic scenarios, for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our overarching goal is to provide a modeling portfolio with flexible and innovative mathematical and computational approaches. We aim to address several questions commonly asked about seasonal and pandemic influenza and match these with analytical methods and outbreak projections. The modeling and data developed in this project can help facilitate and justify transparent public health decisions, while contributing to the definition of standard methods for model selection and validation. Finally, our influenza modeling platform can also benefit the broader network of modeling teams and can be used to improve result sharing and harmonization of modeling approaches. The objective of this proposal is to advance the science of modeling and contribute novel methods and data analytics tools that will increase the understanding of seasonal and pandemic influenza in the context of the network of modeling teams coordinated by the CDC. To address these challenges, we plan to develop a novel global modeling framework, contribute new data and methods for improve the accuracy and validation of flu modeling approaches, and evolve successful methodologies to advance the analysis of layered intervention with artificial Intelligence.",FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control,10071782,U01IP001137,[' '],NCIRD,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,371721,-0.013549861506067183
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,-0.02225390911486465
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers.

"Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults in Pennsylvania 1 Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence  2 and prevalence are increasing in this age group. However, due to limitations of traditional surveillance  3 strategies, it remains unknown whether these increases are in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Electronic health  4 record (EHR)-based surveillance is a relatively simple, sustainable, and timely alternative to more traditional  5 methods. Recognizing the attributes of EHR-based surveillance, the Centers for Disease Control and  6 Prevention (CDC) has funded efforts to develop, evaluate, and deploy EHR-based surveillance of diabetes,  7 including the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study and the Diabetes in Young Adults (DiYA) Study.  8 However, the geographic coverage of these studies has been limited. The geographical gaps in these studies  9 are problematic, as there are known geographic disparities in diabetes prevalence and incidence. Moreover, 10 little is known about how the methods applied in these studies will perform in other regions of the country, in 11 rural communities, and in other health systems. The proposed study will use more than two decades of EHR 12 data and administrative claims data to develop and implement EHR-based surveillance of type 1 and type 2 13 diabetes among young adults in a large region of Pennsylvania, the state with the 5th highest prevalence of 14 diabetes in this age group. This information is essential to informing public health strategies, assessing disease 15 burden, and prioritizing type-specific health services. We will use EHR data from Geisinger, a health system 16 serving a large and diverse region of Pennsylvania, to expand the geography of existing surveillance of 17 diabetes subtypes in young adults to the Middle Atlantic, an area without prior EHR-based diabetes 18 surveillance estimates. This region includes a combination of rural and urban communities, enabling us to 19 evaluate differences in the performance of EHR-based algorithms for case ascertainment by community type. 20 In the first phase of the study, we will evaluate the validity; simplicity; and consistency of EHR-based 21 algorithms for identifying diabetes subtypes. This work will build on previously developed algorithms from the 22 SEARCH and DiYA studies. We will use manual review of clinician notes as the gold standard to determine the 23 positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of these algorithms. We propose to use an innovative, 24 efficient, and rigorous validation approach that incorporates natural language processing of clinician notes. We 25 will use a secondary data source, administrative claims data, to assess data completeness and our ability to 26 distinguish between incident and prevalent cases. In the second phase, we will use the best performing 27 algorithms to report on the annual incidence and prevalence of diabetes, by type, in young adults, between 28 2014 and 2024 in 38 Pennsylvania counties. All analyses will be stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance 29 status, and community type (rural/urban). Finally, we will coordinate with CDC and other sites to conduct joint 30 analyses of aggregated data, greatly expanding the population under study. Narrative Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence and prevalence estimates in this age group have been increasing.

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10017203,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,496235,-0.019098484902051995
"Clinical and Translational Science Award PROJECT SUMMARY: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. COVID-19 cases in the New York City tri-state area have reached an extraordinarily high number and have quickly become the epicenter region of the crisis in the United States. In New York State alone, there are over 372,000 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2020. NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has been particularly hard hit, with more than 8,100 COVID-19 hospitalizations to date. In response, the entire clinical research community is marshalling resources in an attempt to improve our understanding of how the virus spreads, how it infects various tissues in the body, which patients are more susceptible to infection and fatal outcomes, which therapeutics improve symptoms and survival, whether the immune response confers long-lasting protection against reinfection, and many other crucially important questions. The complexity of the development of this disease and unpredictability of progression into severity, as well as the variety of phenotypic outcomes observed during and post COVID-19, pose major challenges in understanding, predicting, preventing, managing and treating this disease and its sequelae. Answers to these challenges can only be achieved through the comprehensive analysis of a significantly high number of COVID cases. Given how recent and unknown this disease is, and its inherent epidemic nature, there is a limited number of cases at individual medical institutions. The limitation of number of cases per institution becomes even more relevant when isolating subpopulations with specific health conditions and across the lifespan. This proposed study will aim to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by supporting the formation of a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S.: COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19). COMBATCOVID will bring together electronic health records (EHR) data from multiple participating institutions into a shared centralized database. As part of the COMBATCOVID effort, biorepository data of COVID-19 patients collected by some of the participating institutions will also be shared and linked to the respective EHR data. The COMBATCOVID consortium will be responsible for transferring EHR data pertaining to participating institutions interested in contributing EHR data to the N3C database. PROJECT NARRATIVE: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. To adequately understand the virus much more data is needed, necessitating sharing of data across multiple institutions.

"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10042096,R03HS027671,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,41981,-0.009988894333971555
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9967059,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'effectiveness testing', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'ventilation', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulator']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,319874,-0.011327686139192583
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium.

"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses. (Bioinformatics Resource Core) PROJECT NARRATIVE  The BWH CCCR, or “VERITY” (Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics) Cores will implement novel analytic methods and outcome measures that address existing and emerging needs in clinical research for preventing and treating rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders. The pressing clinical research needs addressed by VERITY include: a) integration of patients’ point of view (patient-centeredness); b) facilitation of innovative trials; c) incorporation of state of the art comparative effectiveness research methods to determine optimal treatments; d) development and testing of innovative behavioral interventions; and e) identification of relevant phenotypes and sub-phenotypes of common and uncommon rheumatic and MSK diseases using electronic medical records (EMRs), registries, cohorts and insurance claims.","VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics",10017653,P30AR072577,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harvest', 'Health Technology', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Lupus', 'Measurable', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'behavioral economics', 'bioinformatics resource', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'design', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'multidimensional data', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient engagement', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment strategy']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,P30,2020,893894,-0.01956082226646324
"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, and data quality is even more imperative to achieve to reach the potential of this registry. Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,9953684,R21EY031443,"['Academy', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exfoliation Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Iris', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Secondary to', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data submission', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'research study', 'tool', 'treatment comparison']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,231000,-0.028189474965554726
"Center for Clinical and Translational Science The COVID-19 global emergency raises many difficult patient care and healthcare management questions. Which drugs are the most viable candidates for a given patient? How can we efficiently and effectively assemble the right cohort for a trial? What social determinants impact course and outcome? How can we rapidly deploy clinical decision support tools when new knowledge is available every day? The N3C is a partnership across the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, distributed clinical data networks (PCORnet, OHDSI, ACT/i2b2, TriNetX), and other partner organizations. The N3C aims to improve the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with COVID-19 clinical data, expand our ability to analyze and understand COVID, and demonstrate a novel approach for collaborative pandemic data sharing.

"South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute (SCTR) PROJECT SUMMARY – SCTR INSTITUTE Parent Award UL1-TR001450 Since 2009, the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute (SCTR) has transformed the research environment across South Carolina (SC) by creating a Learning Health System that supports high- quality clinical and translational research (CTR) and fosters collaboration and innovation. Headquartered at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), SCTR has engaged stakeholders and created statewide partnerships to improve care and address social determinants of health across SC. However, greater than 75% of SC is rural, and all 46 counties contain areas designated as medically underserved, so health disparities remain an issue. Over the next five years, SCTR will strengthen its outreach to these medically underserved areas through collaboration with the Clemson University Health Extension Program and the MUSC Telehealth Center of Excellence. With a focus on implementation and dissemination as well as discovery, we will develop and demonstrate innovative technologies and outreach to improve the health of our stakeholders. We will build on prior successes and introduce innovative approaches to expand CTR across SC through the following aims: Aim 1. Extend and enhance high-quality, innovative, flexible curricula and training experiences for all levels of the CTR workforce, with particular emphasis on enhancing workforce heterogeneity and team science. Aim 2. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders as active partners in CTR to address health care priorities while enhancing the scientific knowledge base about collaboration and engagement. Aim 3. Promote greater inclusion across the full translational spectrum of research by engaging investigators from many disciplines and patient populations from diverse demographic backgrounds and geographic areas. Aim 4. Develop, demonstrate and disseminate innovative methods and processes to address barriers and accelerate the translation of research discoveries to improvements in human health that can be generalized to a variety of practice settings. Aim 5. Enhance the conduct of translational research through the development of secure and innovative informatics and digital health solutions, tools and methodologies that affect every aspect of CTR. SCTR’s vision is to be a major force in facilitating the translation of innovative science into practice to address the health priorities of the citizens of SC and beyond. To achieve this vision, SCTR’s mission is to catalyze the development of methods and technologies that lead to more efficient translation of biomedical discoveries into interventions that improve individual and public health. SCTR will serve as the statewide academic home for CTR, one that is well-integrated with SC’s healthcare systems and provides essential support for innovative, efficient, multidisciplinary research and research training. We will work within SCTR, with our partners across SC and with the CTSA Consortium to realize this vision.

"Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries Project Summary: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. Advancing a tool such as an electrode, injection pipette or optical fiber through a small hole in the cranium, sometimes over long distances, and placing it precisely in a particular brain area, often much less than one millimeter in diameter, is a significant experimental challenge. Any time an investigator misses the target brain area and the experiment fails as a result, a significant amount of work is lost, additional animals get sacrificed, materials are wasted, and the pace of scientific discovery has been slowed. Even in cases when experiments succeed, they can be difficult to reproduce because many research groups rely on their most experienced lab members and their “special touch” to perform these procedures – thereby adding an element of non- quantitativeness to the procedures, effectively making the experiment less reproducible. We propose to develop a novel stereotaxic apparatus which will overcome many of these shortcomings. Our device features a radically different mechanical design which is natively compatible with both traditional and novel in-vivo techniques. We propose to combine computer 3D vision and robotics for automatic and software guided adjustments of the animal's skull. Landmarks are measured with 3D vision, based on structured illumination at a level of accuracy that has not been accomplished by any of the existing devices. This information will guide a robotic platform to position the animal for the experiment. Finally, we propose to develop an open software platform for neuronavigation that will allow investigators to use the platform with any small animal species they desire to use. Brain atlas systems for neuronavigation can either be downloaded from a cloud based site, or produced de-novo by the investigator by preparing a single set of MRI and CT scans from one sample animal. Our device will help make stereotaxic procedures more accurate and less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Narrative: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. These devices will help make stereotaxic procedures less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Most importantly, they will help reduce or eliminate failed experiments due to mistargeted interventions, thereby accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.",Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries,10080673,R41NS119079,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Monitor', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age group', 'base', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'brain tissue', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cranium', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic strain', 'hexapod', 'in vivo', 'laboratory experience', 'member', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'operation', 'optical fiber', 'programs', 'prototype', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wasting']",NINDS,POPNEURON LTD.,R41,2020,251960,-0.03852871386296131
"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence. The proposed methods are firmly grounded in modern semiparametric theory which will be used to obtain more robust and efficient inferences about causal effects in a broad range of public health applications including in Epidemiology of Aging, Environmental Health Epidemiology and HIV/AIDS Prevention.",Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences,9859751,R01AG065276,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Africa', 'Aging', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Botswana', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetic', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Randomized', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical method', 'c new', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'intervention effect', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'uptake', 'user friendly software']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,502013,-0.061744179675078205
"Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (N3C Supplement) PROJECT SUMMARY Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Tufts CTSI) is based on the conviction that authentic involvement of the entire spectrum of clinical and translational research (CTR) is critical to fulfilling the promise of biomedical science for meeting the public's needs. This includes not only from translation from bench to bedside (T1 translation), but also, crucially for having health impact, translation into effective clinical practice (T2), care delivery and public health (T3), and health policy (T4). Advances on all of these fronts is increasingly dependent on making effective use of scientific data from multiple domains. The COVID-19 global emergency presents both an immediate challenge and an opportunity to progress on important data sharing aims emphasized by NIH. In response, NCATS and the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, and other partnering organizations have committed to developing a next-generation repository for clinical data related to COVID-19, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), as a means of accelerating global research into the disease and aiding the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. The N3C initiative's goal of improving the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with clinical data is consistent with the primary informatics objectives of Tufts CTSI, which am to reduce barriers to the integration of healthcare and research by providing innovative systems, data repositories, and analytical tools, and by enabling greater exchange and collaboration through interoperability, standardization, and resource sharing. In- line with shared objectives, in this supplement we seek to contribute to the N3C initiative as a data provider and thought partner through the following specific aims: (1) continue to play an important role providing tools and resources for N3C's analytics platform; and (2) ensure Tufts CTSI's Informatics Program has sufficient staff and technical resources to continue to provide COVID-specific patient data from our hub to the N3C repository.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times.

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9924443,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2020,7143424,-0.014360213374074888
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society.

"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMap™, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis.

"Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) PROJECT SUMMARY Medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that can leach and cause acute contact dermatitis (ACD) after repeated exposure or prolonged contact of the skin to these toxins. ACD is credited for 10-15% of all occupational illnesses and is also the second highest reported occupational hazard. Given its prevalence, ACD is also a great public health burden with combined yearly costs of up to $1 billion, which spans including medical costs, worker’s compensation and lost working time due to workplace absence. To this end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated that all medical devices must be evaluated for possible skin sensitization using in vivo animal assays, which includes the Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Although GPMT tests provide valuable data on the skin sensitization effects of potential toxins, these assays are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) recently published a Strategic Roadmap, calling for the development of alternative approaches to reduce animal testing of chemical and medical agents. Thus, there is a stated need to modernize safety evaluation of medical devices to reduce animal testing and shorten the regulatory review time, which would ultimately bring safer devices to the market faster. To address this unmet need, the key objectives of our FDA Phase I SBIR project are to (i) produce rigorously validated computational models for the GPMT assay integrating data obtained in human, mouse, and in vitro assays; and (ii) integrate these models into a software product termed PreSS/MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices). Our specific aims for this study include: 1) collecting, curating, and integrating the largest publicly available dataset for GMPT; 2) creating and validating novel computational models for GMPT data; 3) developing the PreSS/MD web server to allow users to make predictions of skin sensitization potential in medical devices. We will also develop a model for mixtures, including compounds tested jointly in different concentrations, using an approach that we developed previously. Finally, we will implement novel approaches to help users of our PreSS/MD platform interpret the developed models in terms of key chemical features responsible for skin sensitization. In addition, we will employ biomedical knowledge graphs to elucidate Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for skin sensitizers. Successful execution of this Phase I project will yield in the development of PreSS/MD as a centralized resource to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices. We expect this software-as-a-service web server platform will be of great value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis, the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all devices be evaluated for possible skin sensitization effects using in vivo assays such as the Guinea pig maximization test. In the effort to modernize skin sensitization safety evaluation methods to reduce in vivo animal testing, herein we propose to develop a software product, PreSS/-MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization caused by Medical Devices), as an innovative and unique in silico alternative with the potential to better predict human response compared to the existing approaches for skin sensitization assessment. Successful execution of the objectives described in this project will result in a centralized web server platform to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices, which will be of significant value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices.",Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD),10079701,R43ES032371,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Allergic Contact Dermatitis', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cavia', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Contact Dermatitis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Instruction', 'Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Prevalence', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Workers&apos', ' Compensation', 'Workplace', 'adverse outcome', 'chemical release', 'cost', 'experience', 'in silico', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lymph nodes', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'occupational hazard', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'response', 'skin patch', 'software as a service', 'success', 'systemic toxicity', 'tool', 'web portal', 'web server']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R43,2020,167910,-0.019442953590473183
"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current application. Dr. Pittenger will also provide mentorship to students, postdocs, and junior faculty in his own research program and throughout the Department of Psychiatry  Together, these integrated plans for training, research, and mentorship will support a well-established mid-career investigator whose robust research program is producing important insights into the neurobiology and treatment of OCD and TS, and whose dedicated mentorship efforts are helping to establish a new generation of translationally grounded patient-oriented researchers in psychiatric neuroscience.

"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9829517,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data infrastructure', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,307227,-0.02946598372864985
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data dissemination', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient health information', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2020,340000,-0.026467714524971722
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,-0.03253507144087812
