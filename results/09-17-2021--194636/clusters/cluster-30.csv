"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,9887588,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2019,286435,0.0018446571588442754
"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.",Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry,9627997,R01GM121818,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Column Chromatography', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Fertilization', 'Game Theory', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operations Research', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Shotguns', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mass spectrometer', 'mathematical theory', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,315830,-0.02812783738044436
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9670817,R01GM101689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,310202,-0.0007914939438014436
"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins. Reactome is the most comprehensive open source biological pathway knowledgebase. We propose to develop a Reactome IDG portal for understudied proteins, assisting researchers to infer biological functions of understudied proteins.",Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins,9740448,U01CA239069,"['Animal Model', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Genes', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Infectious Agent', 'Level of Evidence', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Technology', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Validation', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'data visualization', 'knowledge base', 'open source', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'web app']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,458758,0.0428143280797636
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9766330,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'competitive environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,468098,-0.0320560159191503
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,9818963,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'learning strategy', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,341716,0.0024036071666987645
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites. The development of new computational methods in combination with generation of experimental binding data will reveal the protein- family specific use of readout modes at atomic, molecular, and cellular scales.",Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,9626789,R35GM130376,"['Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Major Groove', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2019,562362,0.004182054684511347
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9597237,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web server', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,343124,0.059720133664319
"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced.

"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9627995,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,393339,0.03740656280097221
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9759968,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,321795,0.004859677272251979
"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing Project Summary Tissue stiffness varies along organs and tissue types, from very soft (e.g. brain) to intermediate (e.g. digestive organs) and to very stiff (e.g. bone). Sensing this stiffness by cells determines differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival, which are all important for development. Local tissue stiffening is a hallmark of cancer, sensing of which by cancer cells causes further tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding stiffness sensing mechanism is thus essential for designing appropriate treatment strategy against developmental disorders and cancer. The prominent “sensor” for mechanical stiffness of tissue environment is a molecular complex located between the cell and the environment, referred to as a focal adhesion. The first step in stiffness sensing is thought to involve transmission of increased level of a force across molecules in the focal adhesion against higher tissue stiffness, but the underlying biomechanical/molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The challenge in investigating this mechanism is in the dynamic nature of its structure, molecular interaction and mechanical forces affecting its assembly. The goal of this work is to understand whether, how and when the focal adhesion during dynamic assembly from their birth starts to be able to transmit the differential forces against varying tissue stiffness levels. Toward this goal, we have developed a set of experimental, microscopic and computational techniques to measure a small force from the adhesions, to profile heterogeneous dynamics of entire adhesion population, and to link molecular activity to force transmission in statistically confident manner. Specifically, we focus on a tiny dot-like complex called “a nascent adhesion”, an early form of the focal adhesion, and involvement of the mechanical linker protein talin, given its ability to be stretched and expose binding sites for other molecules like a vinculin, another mechanical linker protein. The overall objective of this proposal is to use these techniques to test a novel conceptual model of stiffness sensing in which nascent adhesions are sensitive to the tissue stiffness by talin-mediated transmission of force, which promotes further maturation of them to focal adhesions. We will determine if 1) nascent adhesions can transmits differential levels of force in response to varying ECM stiffness, 2) the main source of force actin cytoskeleton- driven and myosin-independent, 3) there is concurrent recruitment of talin and vinculin as a pre-assembled complex and whether it affects force-transmission in response to the ECM stiffness, and 4) competition for talin binding of talin-binding proteins against actin-binding decreases force transmission by nascent adhesion and impair the ECM stiffness sensing. An enhanced mechanistic understanding of these processes would increase our fundamental knowledge of how cells sense and respond to tissue mechanics. Thus, the proposed studies are relevant to the NIH's mission, as they will lead to new insights in physiology and pathophysiology including tissue development, regeneration and cancer progression. Project Narrative Cells’ ability to sense tissue stiffness has a fundamental impact on tissue development and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. The sensing takes place at the interface between the cells and the extracellular matrix via integrin-based adhesions, but our understanding has been limited to sensing by big, mature adhesions. This proposal seeks to test whether tiny, newly-born adhesions can sense tissue stiffness by accurate measurement of mechanical force transmitted through them and recruitment of early adhesion proteins.",Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing,9880640,R15GM135806,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomechanics', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chimera organism', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'F-Actin', 'Fluorescence', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Integrin Binding', 'Integrins', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organ', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Talin', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction\xa0Force Microscopy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cellular engineering', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'mechanical force', 'migration', 'novel', 'particle', 'polymerization', 'recruit', 'response', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414802,-0.012077591196677279
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods.

"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9647931,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2019,225875,-0.008765342342052894
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,9740715,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,244161,-0.006444420763535174
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9633923,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2019,294912,-0.013782646089970737
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9625817,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,187702,-0.02057433334395355
"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9454479,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,310202,-0.0007914939438014436
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9531422,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2018,468098,-0.0320560159191503
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9382895,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,329119,0.059720133664319
"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9536053,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,369690,0.0014690469673556835
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9435146,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,393339,0.03740656280097221
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9595902,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,321985,0.004859677272251979
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9567985,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,142621,0.015674023638957556
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9456316,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2018,232224,-0.02057433334395355
"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.",Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry,9214942,R01GM121818,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Column Chromatography', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Fertilization', 'Game Theory', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operations Research', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Shotguns', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'mathematical theory', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,332329,-0.02812783738044436
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9309936,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,310202,-0.0007914939438014436
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9353854,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,438098,-0.0320560159191503
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,-0.03141417130765405
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9233159,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,329119,0.059720133664319
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,0.03740656280097221
"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9381212,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Cereals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,439690,0.0014690469673556835
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9285277,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,327738,0.015674023638957556
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9172062,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,584552,-0.0320560159191503
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8998963,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,306949,-0.03141417130765405
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9008644,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2016,343124,0.059720133664319

GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.            ",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,8984813,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2015,273816,0.018013280969529366
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T.

Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer.

"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.            ",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,8984471,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug Regulations', 'Drug resistance', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2015,300000,-0.006801488113258398
"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""  Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation. that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles include transport of transforming growth factor-¿, and secretion of nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1¿ and IL-18. Exosomes may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post- synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.  miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion. Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate 80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.  Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.  Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80¿C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7 unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.  Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis. Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q- PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects. Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE   miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS,8842726,R21NS088138,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anterior', 'Astrocytes', 'Atrophic', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dysesthesias', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gulf War', 'HLA G antigen', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Integrins', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Ligand Binding', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipid Binding', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prions', 'Production', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rabies virus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Stress Tests', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'exhaustion', 'hemodynamics', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'presynaptic', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'response', 'sedentary', 'tau Proteins', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'white matter']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,155500,0.0187746387763085
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules. It is the only IUBMB approved system for classifying transport proteins. Funding of this proposal will allow the maintenance and further development of TCDB, interlinking with related databases, expansion of machine learning approaches for information acquisition, and introduction of approaches for predicting the functions of uncharacterized proteins.

Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8632246,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,334303,-0.03320804929979643
"Molecular Mechanisms of Telomere Length Homeostasis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomere integrity is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly, dysfunctional telomeres can initiate genomic instability, cellular senescence, and organismal aging. Telomere structure is provided by binding of shelterin to telomeric DNA repeats forming a nucleoprotein complex. Similar to the human shelterin, in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shelterin is composed of telomeric sequence-specific double-stranded and single-stranded DNA binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1, respectively, accompanied by their protein interaction partners, Rap1, Poz1, and Tpz1, which form a ""protein bridge"" connecting Taz1 and Pot1. Shelterin protects telomere integrity as well as regulates telomerase. With the parent grant support, we biochemically identified Tpz1 mutants that can individually but specifically disrupt its interactions with Poz1, Ccq1, or Pot1. Using these separation-of-function mutants of Tpz1, we found that the complete linkage between telomere dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins within the shelterin complex is required for defining the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres. Moreover, epistasis analyses revealed that Tpz1 also participates in the activation of telomeres to the extendible state via its interaction with Ccq1. Our results suggest critical regulatory roles of Tpz1 in the telomere ON/OFF binary switch. Here, we request supplemental funds to use emerging technologies and interdisciplinary teams to further advance our mechanistic understanding of shelterin to a new level. The two aims are: (1) Identify shelterin interactomes and post-translational modifications on shelterin components using chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry analysis (CXMS); (2) Reveal the functional roles of Tpz1 in coordinating shelterin components for telomerase-mediated and recombination-based telomere elongation via analyzing telomere sequences using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) next- generation sequencing technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Telomeres are closely involved in stem cell differentiation and cancer cell proliferation. The results of this study will lead to new mechanistc models for telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins. Human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention.

"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""   Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation.  that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of  short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs  (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The  exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that  bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other  target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and  miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles  include transport of transforming growth factor-ß, and secretion of  nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1ß and IL-18. Exosomes  may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to  transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post-  synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also  transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.   miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise  sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein  synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion.  Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression  of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment,  Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate  80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal  fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently  inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is  low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between  subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.   Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface  receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the  nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.   Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met  CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have  been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes  may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and  lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80°C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid  from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic  resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had  equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test  Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7  unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of  exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific  biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.   Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified  from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis  presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome  miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis.  Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of  origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.   SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-  PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after  exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects.  Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.   SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass  spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the  exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface  receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE  miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS,8752205,R21NS088138,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anterior', 'Astrocytes', 'Atrophic', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dysesthesias', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gulf War', 'HLA G antigen', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Integrins', 'Interleukin-18', 'Ligand Binding', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipid Binding', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prions', 'Production', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rabies virus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Stress Tests', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Testing', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'exhaustion', 'hemodynamics', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'response', 'sedentary', 'tau Proteins', 'white matter']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,272125,0.0187746387763085
"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.       n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8679000,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,275230,0.028386689344028385
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3.

They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins. Human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.       n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8470247,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,263721,0.028386689344028385
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies. One source of data is the three-dimensional (3D) structure of biological molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.        Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells. Our proposal is aimed at understanding the common strategies the bacteria use to recognize and deliver the secreted proteins to these specialized secretion systems. The results from our studies are likely to be valuable in the development of novel antimicrobials to treat common infections caused by these organisms.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8280335,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,288150,-0.002852217931150079
"Centrosomin and centrosomes in cell division    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centrioles and centrosomes are conserved organelles in animals that are essential for cell signaling, cell division, and for specialized roles in differentiated cells, impacting organ function in whole animals. Mutations in proteins that function in centriole/basal body assembly or function, or which impact the cilia that grow from basal bodies, comprise the etiological basis for an expanding category of developmental and disease genes. Mutations in genes for other centrosomal proteins like CDK5RAP2, Pericentrin, sas4 and Aspm, are the root cause of related syndromes that affect brain and/or body size, yet an understanding of the connection between function at the centrosome and the causes of disease are unclear. To understand the disease or developmental process, we must first understand the functions of the proteins affected. Here we focus on the Centrosomin family of proteins. A key breakthrough came with mutation studies of Drosophila Centrosomin (CNN), showing that it is required in an early process of mitotic centrosome assembly. Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in animal cells and are required for efficient assembly of microtubules into the bipolar spindle apparatus at mitosis. The molecular functions of centrosome and centriole proteins are largely uncharacterized; indeed, the centrosome ""parts list"" is still being compiled. We employ Drosophila as a model system to investigate the molecular function of Centrosomin (Cnn) and the proteins and processes it impacts. With this model we combine classical and molecular genetic approaches with cell biology and biochemistry, capitalizing on the efficiency and rich tool chest that this model affords. The estimated 70% of human disease genes with homologs in Drosophila validate its use as a model for vertebrate biology. Yet, by employing a mouse mutant for CDK5RAP2, a mouse CNN family member, we bridge these systems and achieve a closer understanding of the pathology that underlies mutations in CDK5RAP2, which cause microcephaly in humans. CNN contains two conserved modules. One domain, near the N-terminus, regulates microtubule assembly at centrosomes, while the second domain at the C-terminus regulates actin organization into cleavage furrows. The first domain functions to recruit a microtubule assembly factor to centrosomes, while the second domain binds directly to Centrocortin (Cen), a novel factor required for cleavage furrow assembly. In mice, CDK5RAP2 mutant cells lose centriole engagement and cohesion, inducing centriole amplification. At mitosis, these excess centrosomes induce multipolar spindle assembly, implicating a role for CDK5RAP2 in centrosome clustering at mitosis. The multiple centrioles also template multiple primary cilia in CDK5RAP2 mutant cells. These findings pave a path toward a deeper understanding of the key processes that centrosomes regulate and that govern the regulation of centrosome replication. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine the mechanisms of MTOC regulation by CNN, 2. Define the role of Centrocortin and its cooperation with CNN in cleavage furrow assembly, and 3. Define the functions of CDK5RAP2 in the mouse. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mutations in genes that function at centrioles and centrosomes cause a host of human disorders due to their importance in so many developmental and physiological processes. These ailments include polycystic kidney disease, deafness, hydrocephaly, obesity, microcephaly, and more. The goal of this proposal is to gain molecular and mechanistic understanding of centrioles and centrosomes, structures found in nearly every cell, in flies and mice and discern the pathology of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH).

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins. Human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.       n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8325094,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,274204,0.028386689344028385
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8100430,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,288150,-0.002852217931150079
"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells. Our proposal is aimed at understanding the common strategies the bacteria use to recognize and deliver the secreted proteins to these specialized secretion systems. The results from our studies are likely to be valuable in the development of novel antimicrobials to treat common infections caused by these organisms.              Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells.

"Centrosomin and centrosomes in cell division    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centrioles and centrosomes are conserved organelles in animals that are essential for cell signaling, cell division, and for specialized roles in differentiated cells, impacting organ function in whole animals. Mutations in proteins that function in centriole/basal body assembly or function, or which impact the cilia that grow from basal bodies, comprise the etiological basis for an expanding category of developmental and disease genes. Mutations in genes for other centrosomal proteins like CDK5RAP2, Pericentrin, sas4 and Aspm, are the root cause of related syndromes that affect brain and/or body size, yet an understanding of the connection between function at the centrosome and the causes of disease are unclear. To understand the disease or developmental process, we must first understand the functions of the proteins affected. Here we focus on the Centrosomin family of proteins. A key breakthrough came with mutation studies of Drosophila Centrosomin (CNN), showing that it is required in an early process of mitotic centrosome assembly. Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in animal cells and are required for efficient assembly of microtubules into the bipolar spindle apparatus at mitosis. The molecular functions of centrosome and centriole proteins are largely uncharacterized; indeed, the centrosome ""parts list"" is still being compiled. We employ Drosophila as a model system to investigate the molecular function of Centrosomin (Cnn) and the proteins and processes it impacts. With this model we combine classical and molecular genetic approaches with cell biology and biochemistry, capitalizing on the efficiency and rich tool chest that this model affords. The estimated 70% of human disease genes with homologs in Drosophila validate its use as a model for vertebrate biology. Yet, by employing a mouse mutant for CDK5RAP2, a mouse CNN family member, we bridge these systems and achieve a closer understanding of the pathology that underlies mutations in CDK5RAP2, which cause microcephaly in humans. CNN contains two conserved modules. One domain, near the N-terminus, regulates microtubule assembly at centrosomes, while the second domain at the C-terminus regulates actin organization into cleavage furrows. The first domain functions to recruit a microtubule assembly factor to centrosomes, while the second domain binds directly to Centrocortin (Cen), a novel factor required for cleavage furrow assembly. In mice, CDK5RAP2 mutant cells lose centriole engagement and cohesion, inducing centriole amplification. At mitosis, these excess centrosomes induce multipolar spindle assembly, implicating a role for CDK5RAP2 in centrosome clustering at mitosis. The multiple centrioles also template multiple primary cilia in CDK5RAP2 mutant cells. These findings pave a path toward a deeper understanding of the key processes that centrosomes regulate and that govern the regulation of centrosome replication. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine the mechanisms of MTOC regulation by CNN, 2. Define the role of Centrocortin and its cooperation with CNN in cleavage furrow assembly, and 3. Define the functions of CDK5RAP2 in the mouse. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mutations in genes that function at centrioles and centrosomes cause a host of human disorders due to their importance in so many developmental and physiological processes.

"Database and Prediction Algorithm for the Leucine-rich Nuclear Export Signals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appropriate cellular localization plays a key role in regulating protein functions. Active traffic of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated primarily by members of the Karyopherin 2 family (Kap2), which bind their transport substrates through distinct nuclear localization or export signals (NLSs or NESs). The long term objectives of the applicant are to understand the recognition mechanisms and functional programs for each Kap2 pathway. This project focuses on the most prominent export- Kap2 CRM1. CRM1 is the nuclear export receptor for hundreds of macromolecules with diverse functions, and hence is an important regulator of many cellular processes. This proposal describes a computational/bioinformatics project to compile an up-to-date LR-NES database and develop a structure- and sequence-based LR-NES prediction program. The first goal of this project is to compile a LR-NES database that will include most of the experimentally validated natural and synthetic LR-NES containing proteins published in the literature. The information will be stored in a MySQL database and be made available through the Internet. Each entry will include the detailed information for the protein regarding its export properties, such as the functional export signal, critical residues required for export, determined or predicted secondary structure of the export signal, etc. The second goal of this project is to develop a structure- and sequence-based LR-NES prediction algorithm. The consensus sequence of LR-NESs is diverse, vague, and prevalent. As a result, the only available predictor of LR-NES, which is based on sequence alone, is only marginally useful. This project seeks to use the structural requirements obtained from the newly available crystal structure of CRM1 bound to a LR-NES- containing cargo to filter the LR-NES sequence patterns and thereby greatly increase the prediction accuracy. The project will provide insights into how different NESs interacts with CRM1 and aid in the development of future therapeutics (inhibitors and gene targeting agents) targeted at the CRM1 export pathway to control various disease states including cancer and viral replications.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a bioinformatics project to compile a database and a prediction program for the leucine-rich nuclear export signals recognized by CRM1, which is a nuclear export receptor for hundreds of proteins with diverse functions.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors. This work will lead to the identification of a new catalog of virulence factors associated with establishment of Q fever, and provide novel targets for antimicrobial development              RELEVANCE STATEMENT The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport.

"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology. The relevance of this work for public health is that comprehensive integration and standardization of biomedical and genomics information is an essential component of advancing the understanding of the molecular systems underlying human health and disease outcomes.             n/a",Gene Ontology Consortium,8061704,P41HG002273,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comparative Biology', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'EST Library', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'comparative', 'data format', 'empowered', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'human disease', 'information model', 'interest', 'model organisms databases', 'repository', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,P41,2011,2923298,0.016180179869210352
"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The long term goal of the project is to understand the cellular mechanism of how neurons build the intricate dendritic and axonal branch structure that distinguishes them from other cell types.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7842572,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2010,327180,-0.024847764358392192

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4. Creation and maintenance of a wiki-themed documentation resource.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Molecular evolutionary analyses are central to many aspects of basic, translational, and applied biomedical research. Examples include identifying gene mutations that allow pathogens to evade the immune response; prediction of the structure and function of proteins; estimating the evolutionary relatedness of human or other populations; characterizing the magnitude of selective pressure, either natural or artificial, on genes or species.           Project Narrative Molecular evolutionary analyses are central to many aspects of basic, translational, and applied biomedical research.

"Prediction of Protein Crystallization and Diffraction Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the key role that crystallography plays in structural biology, protein crystallization remains a significant bottleneck affecting a broad range of research programs. We developing a data-mining framework, PROSPERO, that can predict crystallization success and crystal diffraction quality based on characterization of specific protein properties available prior to large-scale crystallization trials. This will increase the efficiency and overall success rates of diffraction studies by individual research programs as well as by genome-scale projects. PROSPERO will perform a meta-analysis of many individual predictors based on statistical and machine-learning methods. A key feature of this framework is that it can dynamically re-estimate success/failure rates based on the current contents of the underlying database, and on the set of physical characterization data provided by individual users. The design will be modular, in that we will define a standard set of application interfaces (APIs) for supplying new categories of data to the core data storage, meta-analysis and prediction components. This will allow use of PROSPERO to be tailored to individual research programs, to target-specific physical properties, and to incorporate new physical characterization techniques. Our long-term goal is to grow a user community that will benefit from the continually improving predictions made by a central PROSPERO web server, that will contribute new input modules based on data produced by standard laboratory protocols and apparatus, and will also contribute to the population of the underlying database of results used for prediction.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-ray crystallography is a core technique in fundamental research programs that seek to understand disease mechanisms based on the three-dimensional structure of individual proteins, of large multi-protein complexes, and of larger assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids into key components of the cell.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7825413,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,R01,2010,273781,-0.02411356758371752
"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7895064,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,291060,-0.002852217931150079
"Centrosomin and centrosomes in cell division    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centrioles and centrosomes are conserved organelles in animals that are essential for cell signaling, cell division, and for specialized roles in differentiated cells, impacting organ function in whole animals. Mutations in proteins that function in centriole/basal body assembly or function, or which impact the cilia that grow from basal bodies, comprise the etiological basis for an expanding category of developmental and disease genes. Mutations in genes for other centrosomal proteins like CDK5RAP2, Pericentrin, sas4 and Aspm, are the root cause of related syndromes that affect brain and/or body size, yet an understanding of the connection between function at the centrosome and the causes of disease are unclear. To understand the disease or developmental process, we must first understand the functions of the proteins affected. Here we focus on the Centrosomin family of proteins. A key breakthrough came with mutation studies of Drosophila Centrosomin (CNN), showing that it is required in an early process of mitotic centrosome assembly. Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in animal cells and are required for efficient assembly of microtubules into the bipolar spindle apparatus at mitosis. The molecular functions of centrosome and centriole proteins are largely uncharacterized; indeed, the centrosome ""parts list"" is still being compiled. We employ Drosophila as a model system to investigate the molecular function of Centrosomin (Cnn) and the proteins and processes it impacts. With this model we combine classical and molecular genetic approaches with cell biology and biochemistry, capitalizing on the efficiency and rich tool chest that this model affords. The estimated 70% of human disease genes with homologs in Drosophila validate its use as a model for vertebrate biology. Yet, by employing a mouse mutant for CDK5RAP2, a mouse CNN family member, we bridge these systems and achieve a closer understanding of the pathology that underlies mutations in CDK5RAP2, which cause microcephaly in humans. CNN contains two conserved modules. One domain, near the N-terminus, regulates microtubule assembly at centrosomes, while the second domain at the C-terminus regulates actin organization into cleavage furrows. The first domain functions to recruit a microtubule assembly factor to centrosomes, while the second domain binds directly to Centrocortin (Cen), a novel factor required for cleavage furrow assembly. In mice, CDK5RAP2 mutant cells lose centriole engagement and cohesion, inducing centriole amplification. At mitosis, these excess centrosomes induce multipolar spindle assembly, implicating a role for CDK5RAP2 in centrosome clustering at mitosis. The multiple centrioles also template multiple primary cilia in CDK5RAP2 mutant cells. These findings pave a path toward a deeper understanding of the key processes that centrosomes regulate and that govern the regulation of centrosome replication. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine the mechanisms of MTOC regulation by CNN, 2. Define the role of Centrocortin and its cooperation with CNN in cleavage furrow assembly, and 3. Define the functions of CDK5RAP2 in the mouse.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors.

"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7906880,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2010,498935,-0.007526389762338109
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,8112998,R01AI064913,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Descriptor', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Epitopes', 'Escape Mutant', 'Flavivirus', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Histamine Release', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immunotherapy', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Proteins', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computerized tools', 'env Gene Products', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'practical application', 'protein complex', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2010,252819,0.04834750384325818
"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7625220,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,330166,-0.024847764358392192
"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7628516,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2009,329306,0.0080826952673279
"Prediction of Protein Crystallization and Diffraction Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the key role that crystallography plays in structural biology, protein crystallization remains a significant bottleneck affecting a broad range of research programs. We developing a data-mining framework, PROSPERO, that can predict crystallization success and crystal diffraction quality based on characterization of specific protein properties available prior to large-scale crystallization trials. This will increase the efficiency and overall success rates of diffraction studies by individual research programs as well as by genome-scale projects. PROSPERO will perform a meta-analysis of many individual predictors based on statistical and machine-learning methods. A key feature of this framework is that it can dynamically re-estimate success/failure rates based on the current contents of the underlying database, and on the set of physical characterization data provided by individual users. The design will be modular, in that we will define a standard set of application interfaces (APIs) for supplying new categories of data to the core data storage, meta-analysis and prediction components. This will allow use of PROSPERO to be tailored to individual research programs, to target-specific physical properties, and to incorporate new physical characterization techniques. Our long-term goal is to grow a user community that will benefit from the continually improving predictions made by a central PROSPERO web server, that will contribute new input modules based on data produced by standard laboratory protocols and apparatus, and will also contribute to the population of the underlying database of results used for prediction.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-ray crystallography is a core technique in fundamental research programs that seek to understand disease mechanisms based on the three-dimensional structure of individual proteins, of large multi-protein complexes, and of larger assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids into key components of the cell.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7787322,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,294000,-0.002852217931150079
"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances. The long term goal is to create a meta-server that will become a standard and will revolutionize the protein structure prediction field in an analogous way to the revolution that PSI-BLAST brought about in the sequence-comparison field, a few years ago. n/a",Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server,7576912,R01GM073814,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Code', 'Complement Factor B', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Jackals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Running', 'Services', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2009,239823,-0.028582215727960502
"Centrosomin and centrosomes in cell division    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centrioles and centrosomes are conserved organelles in animals that are essential for cell signaling, cell division, and for specialized roles in differentiated cells, impacting organ function in whole animals. Mutations in proteins that function in centriole/basal body assembly or function, or which impact the cilia that grow from basal bodies, comprise the etiological basis for an expanding category of developmental and disease genes. Mutations in genes for other centrosomal proteins like CDK5RAP2, Pericentrin, sas4 and Aspm, are the root cause of related syndromes that affect brain and/or body size, yet an understanding of the connection between function at the centrosome and the causes of disease are unclear. To understand the disease or developmental process, we must first understand the functions of the proteins affected. Here we focus on the Centrosomin family of proteins. A key breakthrough came with mutation studies of Drosophila Centrosomin (CNN), showing that it is required in an early process of mitotic centrosome assembly. Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in animal cells and are required for efficient assembly of microtubules into the bipolar spindle apparatus at mitosis. The molecular functions of centrosome and centriole proteins are largely uncharacterized; indeed, the centrosome ""parts list"" is still being compiled. We employ Drosophila as a model system to investigate the molecular function of Centrosomin (Cnn) and the proteins and processes it impacts. With this model we combine classical and molecular genetic approaches with cell biology and biochemistry, capitalizing on the efficiency and rich tool chest that this model affords. The estimated 70% of human disease genes with homologs in Drosophila validate its use as a model for vertebrate biology. Yet, by employing a mouse mutant for CDK5RAP2, a mouse CNN family member, we bridge these systems and achieve a closer understanding of the pathology that underlies mutations in CDK5RAP2, which cause microcephaly in humans. CNN contains two conserved modules. One domain, near the N-terminus, regulates microtubule assembly at centrosomes, while the second domain at the C-terminus regulates actin organization into cleavage furrows. The first domain functions to recruit a microtubule assembly factor to centrosomes, while the second domain binds directly to Centrocortin (Cen), a novel factor required for cleavage furrow assembly. In mice, CDK5RAP2 mutant cells lose centriole engagement and cohesion, inducing centriole amplification. At mitosis, these excess centrosomes induce multipolar spindle assembly, implicating a role for CDK5RAP2 in centrosome clustering at mitosis. The multiple centrioles also template multiple primary cilia in CDK5RAP2 mutant cells. These findings pave a path toward a deeper understanding of the key processes that centrosomes regulate and that govern the regulation of centrosome replication. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine the mechanisms of MTOC regulation by CNN, 2. Define the role of Centrocortin and its cooperation with CNN in cleavage furrow assembly, and 3. Define the functions of CDK5RAP2 in the mouse. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mutations in genes that function at centrioles and centrosomes cause a host of human disorders due to their importance in so many developmental and physiological processes. These ailments include polycystic kidney disease, deafness, hydrocephaly, obesity, microcephaly, and more.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun. Genes act as blueprints for RNA and proteins, the workhorses of the cell.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways. These aims will be pursued in collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Computing Simbios at Stanford U.          n/a",Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems,7556196,R01GM086238,"['Algorithms', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cell physiology', 'Cereals', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Nature', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chaperonin', 'computer framework', 'data modeling', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'network models', 'novel', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'simulation', 'structural genomics', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,327483,0.015272296699874363
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7676045,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2009,494433,-0.007526389762338109
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,7570061,R01AI064913,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Descriptor', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Epitopes', 'Escape Mutant', 'Flavivirus', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Histamine Release', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immunotherapy', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Proteins', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computerized tools', 'env Gene Products', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'practical application', 'protein complex', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2009,280910,0.04834750384325818
"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7389563,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,320418,-0.024847764358392192
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7469442,R01GM072740,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Class', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Dependence', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear RNA', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'falls', 'genetic selection', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'solid state']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2008,291756,0.0006081249797937097
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7477279,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,338976,0.027850785048452665
"Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are implicated in the development of numerous human diseases. Some of the natural substrates for ubiquitination and degradation can induce malignant transformation if not properly removed from the cell. Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          n/a",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7478711,R21CA113711,"['Acute Kidney Failure', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Generations', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Starvation', 'Structural Protein', 'SwissProt', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'human disease', 'improved', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'novel', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,168000,0.0023809970584609636
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7380093,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2008,280033,-0.02411356758371752
"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances. The long term goal is to create a meta-server that will become a standard and will revolutionize the protein structure prediction field in an analogous way to the revolution that PSI-BLAST brought about in the sequence-comparison field, a few years ago. n/a",Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server,7367174,R01GM073814,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Code', 'Complement Factor B', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Jackals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Running', 'Score', 'Services', 'Shotguns', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2008,239823,-0.028582215727960502
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7622959,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'research study', 'response', 'software development', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2008,536748,-0.007526389762338109
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7207482,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,323192,-0.024847764358392192
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification.

Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7282065,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,355458,0.027850785048452665
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7268219,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2007,288025,-0.02411356758371752
"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,7102736,R01GM055735,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'C-terminal', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Diagnosis', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meiosis', 'Microspheres', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Site', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubulin', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'cell motility', 'gamma Tubulin', 'human STK6 protein', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'mutant', 'protein distribution', 'reconstitution', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'tumor', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,211207,0.011229565951115366
"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM). The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HM distances. The long term goal is to create a meta-server that will become a standard and will revolutionize the protein structure prediction field in an analogous way to the revolution that PSI-BLAST brought about in the sequence-comparison field, a few years ago.         n/a",Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server,7185867,R01GM073814,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Code', 'Complement Factor B', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Jackals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Running', 'Score', 'Services', 'Shotguns', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2007,239823,-0.028319965059578643
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"". The components proposed here constitute one crucial building block toward such a 4D map of a cell.          n/a",Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms,7342317,R01GM079767,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Transport', 'Biological databases', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cereals', 'Chloroplasts', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Binding', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Internet', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Left', 'Locales', 'Localized', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Mitochondria', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Localization Signal', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Today', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein function', 'research study', 'software systems', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,294337,0.009579879102963538
"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,7176188,R01AI064913,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Descriptor', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Endopeptidases', 'Epitopes', 'Escape Mutant', 'Flavivirus', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Histamine Release', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immunotherapy', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Proteins', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computerized tools', 'env Gene Products', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'practical application', 'protein structure', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R01,2007,286350,0.04834750384325818
"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology. The relevance of this work for public health is that comprehensive integration and standardization of biomedical and genomics information is an essential component of advancing the understanding of the molecular systems underlying human health and disease outcomes.             n/a",Gene Ontology Consortium,7185305,P41HG002273,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology, Other', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comparative Biology', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'EST Library', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'comparative', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome database', 'human disease', 'interest', 'model organisms databases', 'repository', 'size', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,P41,2007,3146180,0.016180179869210352
"2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Large, integrin-binding proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, and thrombospondin are integral parts of established matrices and are generally discussed at other GRC meetings. Smaller integrin-binding proteins perform many functions other than those of structural scaffolding. One class of small, integrin-binding proteins encoded by five genes clustered on human chromosome 4 are called the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein) family. Members include bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, and osteopontin. Normally expressed by skeletal tissue, SIBLINGs are thought to play a role in mineralization as well as cellular adhesion and migration. Specific SIBLINGs are also induced in a number of different cancer types including breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and thyroid cancers. Individual SIBLING family members have been found to promote angiogenesis and invasiveness. A second small integrinbinding gene family is the connective tissue growth factor/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma overexpressed (CCN) family of proteins. Members of the CNN family contain a conserved insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein motif and are secreted extracellular matrix proteins. CCNs are involved in diverse biological processes such as regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. They play important roles in pregnancy, development, angiogenesis, wound repair and inflammation. Certain CCN genes appear to act as tumor-promoting factors, while other CCNs exhibits suppressive capabilities. The focus of this Gordon Research Conference is on defining state-of-the-art knowledge of the biological activities, biochemical interactions and physiological consequences of small-integrin binding proteins in normal and pathological states. This application has as its specific aims to: (1) Convene an international group of experts on SIBLING and CCN biology; (2) Through multidisciplinary presentations determine the state of the art knowledge on small integrin binding proteins in normal physiological function and cancer pathology; (3) Facilitate cross-fertilization of multiple fields (biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, oncology, inflammation, the SIBLING and CCN fields); and (4) spark translational opportunities in the development of novel ways to use SIBLINGs/CCNs as markers for pathological states and discuss therapeutic applications. These aims are directly relevant to the mission of the NIH. The format follows the standard template for a Gordon Research Conference, with an evening introductory evening session, followed by 4 days of morning sessions, late afternoon poster sessions and evening talks in an environment facilitating the open, unhampered discussion of ideas at the frontiers of science. The principal topics to be addressed are: intracellular processing and function of SIBLINGs/CCNs; genetic regulation of SIBLING and CCN genes; SIBLINGs and CCNs in cancer and inflammation; and bioactive fragments of SIBLINGs/CCNs.              n/a",2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference,7329283,R13HL090059,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Arts', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Class', 'Collagen', 'Colon', 'Cysteine', 'DSPP gene', 'Dentin', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fertilization', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Genus Cola', 'Glycoproteins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth-Factor-Binding Proteins', 'Integrin Binding', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Mission', 'Molecular Biology', 'NOV gene', 'Nephroblastoma', 'Numbers', 'Pancreas', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Siblings', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wound Healing', 'angiogenesis', 'bone sialoprotein', 'cancer type', 'connective tissue growth factor', 'day', 'frontier', 'member', 'migration', 'mineralization', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oncology', 'osteopontin', 'posters', 'scaffold', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NHLBI,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2007,5000,0.037090070450064024
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences.

"Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are implicated in the development of numerous human diseases. Some of the natural substrates for ubiquitination and degradation can induce malignant transformation if not properly removed from the cell. Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          n/a",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7256169,R21CA113711,[' '],NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,188000,0.0023809970584609636
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7071180,R01GM074128,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'chemical structure', 'chemical synthesis', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'glycosylation', 'high throughput technology', 'mass spectrometry', 'mathematics', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'polysaccharides', 'structural biology', 'technology /technique development']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2006,324279,0.0080826952673279
"Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL.

Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.

Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins.

"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids. The achievement of this goal would have implications for rational treatment of heart disease and other, e.g. digestive system related, human diseases that involve the control of free fatty acid levels.     n/a",Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity,7054052,R01GM064746,"['alanine', 'alcohols', 'artificial intelligence', 'chemical models', 'fatty acid binding protein', 'fatty acid transport', 'fatty acids', 'gene mutation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lipid bilayer membrane', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein structure function', 'site directed mutagenesis', 'thermodynamics', 'water']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,264908,0.01969727769689515
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6990509,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer simulation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'statistics /biometry', 'transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2006,246078,-0.009933212196553444
"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7117852,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,326259,0.027850785048452665
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases.

"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,6929714,R01GM055735,"['RNA interference', 'cell component structure /function', 'cell cycle proteins', 'centrosome', 'confocal scanning microscopy', 'electron microscopy', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rabbit', 'laboratory rat', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'molecular assembly /self assembly', 'nuclear proteins', 'phosphorylation', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'time resolved data', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,R01,2005,222750,0.011229565951115366

"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids. The achievement of this goal would have implications for rational treatment of heart disease and other, e.g. digestive system related, human diseases that involve the control of free fatty acid levels.     n/a",Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity,6891406,R01GM064746,"['alanine', 'alcohols', 'artificial intelligence', 'chemical models', 'fatty acid binding protein', 'fatty acid transport', 'fatty acids', 'gene mutation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lipid bilayer membrane', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein structure function', 'site directed mutagenesis', 'thermodynamics', 'water']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,271302,0.01969727769689515
"The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A wide variety of biological processes and signals are mediated by patterns detectable at the sequence level in proteins, DNA and RNA. For example, one facet of transcriptional regulation of genes involves proteins (transcription factors) recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequence patterns. Other examples of important biological sequence patterns include protein structural domains, microRNAs and the protein target sequences of kinases. The MEME suite of bioinformatics software tools provide biologists with powerful methods for discovering, analyzing and interpreting biological sequence patterns of many types, including those mentioned above. The suite includes one tool - MEME -- that biologists use to discover novel sequence patterns (motifs), and three tools -- Meta-MEME, MCAST and MAST -- that biologists use to search sequence databases for matches to motif-based sequence models. This grant will enable us to dramatically improve the scientific value of the suite to the thousands of biologists who already use it. These improvements will be visible to the biologist using the suite as increased availability, better support, better user-interface and documentation, more powerful algorithms, better interoperability, and faster release cycles. We will achieve these goals via a combination of three specific aims: (1) improved software engineering, (2) ongoing support and (3) continued software development of the suite. n/a",The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools,6907504,R01RR021692,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'mathematical model', 'microRNAs', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure', 'transcription factor']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,307663,-0.012865869331425825
"BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Geospiza Inc. and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) are creating a standards based software framework around NCSA's Heirarchical Data Format (HDF5). The envisioned framework will integrate algorithms important in DNA and protein sequence analysis to create scalable high throughput software systems which will be accessed using new graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to provide researchers with new views of their data to finish sequencing projects in large-scale genome sequencing, microbial genome sequencing, viral epidemiology, polymorphism detection, phylogenetic analysis, multi-locus sequence typing, confirmatory sequencing, and EST analysis.    In our vision, algorithms will be either integrated into the system to directly read and write from HDF5 project files, or they will communicate with project files via filter programs that produce standardized XML formatted data. Through this model, a scalable solution will support different applications of DNA sequencing, fulfilling the many needs and requirements expressed by the medical research community now and into the future. As the first step in this process we will, define requirements for editing and versioning data in DNA sequencing, research and propose data models for the computational phases of DNA sequencing and annotating DNA sequence data using existing standards, create a prototype application for DNA sequencing based SNP discovery, and engage the bioinformatics community for BioHDF adoption.       In the past ten years the cost of sequencing DNA has dropped over 1000 fold and the amount of raw sequence data, entering our national repositories is doubling every 12 months. DNA sequencing is fundamental to biological research activities such as genomics, systems biology, and clinical medicine. Proposals are being sought to decrease sequencing costs by two orders of magnitude through technology refinements with an ultimate vision of developing technology to sequence human genome equivalents for $1000 each. The amount of data that will be produced through these endeavors is unimaginable. However, the $1,000 genome will not advance medical research unless we integrate all phases of the DNA sequencing process and treat the creation, management, finishing, analysis, and sharing of the data as common goals. n/a",BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics,6992995,R41HG003792,"['DNA', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic mapping', 'genetic polymorphism', 'mathematics', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'virus genetics']",NHGRI,"GEOSPIZA, INC.",R41,2005,142775,-0.027683654066126818
"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,6916795,R01AI064913,"['B lymphocyte', 'T lymphocyte', 'allergens', 'aminoacid', 'antigens', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'chemical property', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dengue virus', 'immunoglobulin E', 'major histocompatibility complex', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'peptides', 'physical property', 'protein binding', 'stereochemistry', 'structural biology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R01,2005,264250,0.04834750384325818
"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,6942980,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,324673,0.027850785048452665
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells. Experience gained in the course of these studies will be used to direct and refine hardware and software development.           n/a",FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY,6846631,R01GM060678,"['Urodela', 'Xenopus', 'animal tissue', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'centromere', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent dye /probe', 'image enhancement', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'small interfering RNA', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2005,451020,0.021567181968128686
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,6966860,R01GM072740,"['Internet', 'RNA splicing', 'binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'genetic regulation', 'messenger RNA', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular shape', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2005,304845,0.0006081249797937097
"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,6829771,R01GM055735,"['RNA interference', 'cell component structure /function', 'cell cycle proteins', 'centrosome', 'confocal scanning microscopy', 'electron microscopy', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rabbit', 'laboratory rat', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'molecular assembly /self assembly', 'nuclear proteins', 'phosphorylation', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'time resolved data', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,R01,2004,218770,0.011229565951115366
"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management. Phrap, Cross_Match,                  RepeatMasker and Consed are four programs that played an integral role in the        human genome project and became accepted as standard. However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community. In this project we        will re-engineer Phrap, Cross_Match and Repeat Masker to improve performance by      optimizing these algorithms and developing a hierarchical data file to store         and manipulate assembled sequence data. Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly.

"Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.  Here, we propose a variety of technical and scientific solutions improving the functionality of PredictProtein. (1) The technical solutions address job and data handling, database update, user interface, web page layout, presentation of results, and directly linking original resources. (2) The systematic combination of methods requires evaluating these in parallel on identical tasks, e.g., at which level of probability should a signal peptide prediction override the membrane prediction. Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins. As a particular example for using structural information to improve the reliability of inferring function, we propose to investigate the conservation of enzymatic activity.         n/a",Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein,6744087,R01LM007329,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'enzyme activity', 'informatics', 'information systems', 'membrane proteins', 'protein signal sequence', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,343133,-0.01429837583877859
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement.

We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,6825272,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,396367,0.027850785048452665
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells. Experience gained in the course of these studies will be used to direct and refine hardware and software development.           n/a",FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY,6720801,R01GM060678,"['Urodela', 'Xenopus', 'animal tissue', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'centromere', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent dye /probe', 'image enhancement', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'small interfering RNA', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2004,622682,0.021567181968128686
"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1. The technology developed will be sold as commercial software in Phase III. n/a",A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening,6786885,R43GM071055,"['binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ligands', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"BIOCOMPUTING GROUP, INC.",R43,2004,153420,-0.0381544082622631
"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management.

However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community. In this project we        will re-engineer Phrap, Cross_Match and Repeat Masker to improve performance by      optimizing these algorithms and developing a hierarchical data file to store         and manipulate assembled sequence data. Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly.

"Predictions of structure/function by PredictProtein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.  Here, we propose a variety of technical and scientific solutions improving the functionality of PredictProtein. (1) The technical solutions address job and data handling, database update, user interface, web page layout, presentation of results, and directly linking original resources. (2) The systematic combination of methods requires evaluating these in parallel on identical tasks, e.g., at which level of probability should a signal peptide prediction override the membrane prediction. Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins. As a particular example for using structural information to improve the reliability of inferring function, we propose to investigate the conservation of enzymatic activity.         n/a",Predictions of structure/function by PredictProtein,6610635,R01LM007329,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' enzyme activity', ' informatics', ' information systems', ' membrane proteins', ' protein signal sequence', ' protein structure', ' protein structure function']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,342656,0.0006817386370310623
"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to delineate (at least in theory) all the proteins encoded in the human genome and all of those encoded by the genomes of major human parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease.  However, the vast increase in biological knowledge that has resulted from the last decade of genomic DNA sequencing has led us to a a crisis in bioinformatics.  This crisis is two-fold: analysis of data and planning of experiments.  Most of the scientific resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology.  All modern experimental molecular biology (and, increasingly, structural biology) depends upon the availability of plasmid clones to address specific scientific questions.  Although software facilitating DNA manipulations exists, few programs advise users of optimal strategies and none automate the process of clone generation. Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.         n/a",Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning,6583437,R43GM067279,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' expression cloning', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic manipulation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' transfection /expression vector']",NIGMS,"VIRMATICS, LLC",R43,2003,100000,-0.004738677464984548
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6622146,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer simulation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' statistics /biometry', ' transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2003,252000,-0.009933212196553444
"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids. The achievement of this goal would have implications for rational treatment of heart disease and other, e.g. digestive system related, human diseases that involve the control of free fatty acid levels.     n/a",Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity,6572621,R01GM064746,"['alanine', ' alcohols', ' artificial intelligence', ' chemical models', ' fatty acid binding protein', ' fatty acid transport', ' fatty acids', ' gene mutation', ' intermolecular interaction', ' lipid bilayer membrane', ' molecular dynamics', ' protein structure function', ' site directed mutagenesis', ' thermodynamics', ' water']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,271336,0.01969727769689515
"FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES The goal of the proposed research is to study functional similarities            and differences between proteins with broadly similar structures, but            no recognizable sequence similarity. Automated structure comparison              programs, together with a new generation of fold prediction algorithms,          provide us with many examples of proteins that do, or are likely to,             belong to the same structural class.  At the same time, such broad               structural similarity may or may not be connected to any functional              similarity.  A database of protein structure and function will be built,         allowing a search for groups of proteins with certain structural and             functional features.  Such groups will then be analyzed to identify              structurally and functionally important regions in the sequence and to           match them with levels of structural and functional similarity/                  divergence.  A combination of comparative modeling and structure                 analysis of protein structures will be used and forged into a                    standardized set of theoretical tools and procedures that could be               predicted using threading and sequence analysis, but whose sequence              divergence is large enough to expect significant functional differences.         The overall goal of the research described in this project is to bring           an understanding of the sequence/structure/function relationship or              selected proteins to a level where the detailed predictions of function          and mode of action for newly sequenced proteins could be accomplished.

"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis. Using          budding yeast genetics and digital imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we will           identify molecular components, including MT motor proteins, that are involved        with the coupling of force generation to the assembly/disassembly of MTs. We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs. Finally, we will analyze how MT dynamics may be involved in the               regulation of cytokinesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION,6635816,R01GM024364,"['Urodela', ' Xenopus', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell cycle', ' cell motility', ' centromere', ' chromosome movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system hardware', ' contact inhibition', ' cytoskeletal proteins', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' meiosis', ' microtubules', ' mitotic spindle apparatus', ' nanotechnology', ' photoactivation', ' protein binding', ' protein biosynthesis', ' protein structure function', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture', ' video microscopy', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2003,347106,0.008513849249303138

"Structure based prediction of protein modifications  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genomics revolution has uncovered tens of thousands of proteins, nonetheless full exploitation of organismal genome projects will not occur without innovations in proteomics and structural biology. The agencies meeting this challenge, such as the seven NIH protein structure consortia , have targeted 10,000 new protein structures to be solved by 2010. We propose to use this powerfully enabling structural dataset as the basis for a new type of bioinformatic tool which models and compares the surfaces of proteins, instead of their sequence or backbone path, by analogy to sequence comparison methods. An algorithm that searches a protein's sw-lace features for post-translational modification and binding sites will offer a large step forward. The ability to model protein binding sites will allow investigators to predict how they interact, how regulatory networks are organized, and what determines the order of metabolic pathways--each a fundamental goal of much research. Cognia is well positioned to undertake this effort as we are currently building databases and tools designed to identify drug targets and biotherapeutic candidates for use in both basic research and pharmaceutical-biotech discovery. Our use of predictive tools to analyze, organize, and synthesize the content of databases lends direction to this proposal, and its near-term focus will involve the analysis of post-translational modifications such as the ubiquitylation and SUMOylation accomplished by E3 enzymes during the cell cycle. We anticipate that algorithms developed under this proposal will have many applications, including the ability to (I) predict novel binding interactions of structurally defined proteins (ii) identify structural homologs of proteins not apparent by sequence or backbone similarity searches (iii) define an enzyme's potential substrates, (iv) define structural features of binding sites. In Phase I, we will gather the requisite data and structures and carry out a pilot definition of an E3's consensus binding site. This will provide the foundation for Phase II, where we will create a tool that will scan all known structures for consensi, predicting interactions and modifications.   n/a",Structure based prediction of protein modifications,6551328,R43GM066514,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' posttranslational modifications', ' protein binding', ' protein metabolism', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,COGNIA CORPORATION,R43,2002,96725,-0.043804759740453975
"Genomic application of suspension array technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principle of the proposed project is the application of fluorescent microsphere based suspension array technology (SAT) to the cytometry based simultaneous detection of multi analytes. The proposal consists of four overlapping subprojects: (a) Technological development of biological microbead procedures using cells or microorganisms as substitutes for polymeric microspheres to lower the cost of SAT compared to the cost of methods using microbeads manufactured by polymer chemistry. (b) Development of a test to detect gene translocations and rearragements frequently responsible for malignant transformations. A method based on measuring bead-based hybridization of specific 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of chromosomal translocation breakpoints would allow large scale screening of leukemias and various types of cancers by the measurement of 5'/3' sequence ratio.

"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6440018,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer simulation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' statistics /biometry', ' transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2002,284369,-0.009933212196553444
"FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES The goal of the proposed research is to study functional similarities            and differences between proteins with broadly similar structures, but            no recognizable sequence similarity. Automated structure comparison              programs, together with a new generation of fold prediction algorithms,          provide us with many examples of proteins that do, or are likely to,             belong to the same structural class.  At the same time, such broad               structural similarity may or may not be connected to any functional              similarity.  A database of protein structure and function will be built,         allowing a search for groups of proteins with certain structural and             functional features.  Such groups will then be analyzed to identify              structurally and functionally important regions in the sequence and to           match them with levels of structural and functional similarity/                  divergence.  A combination of comparative modeling and structure                 analysis of protein structures will be used and forged into a                    standardized set of theoretical tools and procedures that could be               predicted using threading and sequence analysis, but whose sequence              divergence is large enough to expect significant functional differences.         The overall goal of the research described in this project is to bring           an understanding of the sequence/structure/function relationship or              selected proteins to a level where the detailed predictions of function          and mode of action for newly sequenced proteins could be accomplished.           With the flood of new sequences coming from large scale genome                   sequencing projects, it is identifying the possible function of these            proteins that would make these data so important.                                 n/a",FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES,6498699,R01GM060049,"['DNA binding protein', ' RNA binding protein', ' active sites', ' artificial intelligence', ' binding proteins', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' molecular biology information system', ' open reading frames', ' periplasm', ' physical model', ' protein folding', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' structural biology', ' thermodynamics']",NIGMS,BURNHAM INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R01,2002,202646,-0.027625614669115995
"GENE PREDICTION: MARKOV MODELS AND COMPLEMENTARY METHODS   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): The goal of the project                                               is to build more accurate and powerful DNA sequence interpretation algorithms        utilizing the positive experience and ideas of previously proven GeneMark and        GenMark.hmm methods.

"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis. Using          budding yeast genetics and digital imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we will           identify molecular components, including MT motor proteins, that are involved        with the coupling of force generation to the assembly/disassembly of MTs. We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs. Finally, we will analyze how MT dynamics may be involved in the               regulation of cytokinesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION,6518950,R01GM024364,"['Urodela', ' Xenopus', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell cycle', ' cell motility', ' centromere', ' chromosome movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system hardware', ' contact inhibition', ' cytoskeletal proteins', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' meiosis', ' microtubules', ' mitotic spindle apparatus', ' nanotechnology', ' photoactivation', ' protein binding', ' protein biosynthesis', ' protein structure function', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture', ' video microscopy', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2002,337253,0.008513849249303138

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.  n/a",PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,6182183,R21GM059398,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electron crystallography', ' electron density', ' molecular biology information system', ' physical model', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2000,101500,-0.016223755967215467
"FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES The goal of the proposed research is to study functional similarities            and differences between proteins with broadly similar structures, but            no recognizable sequence similarity. Automated structure comparison              programs, together with a new generation of fold prediction algorithms,          provide us with many examples of proteins that do, or are likely to,             belong to the same structural class.  At the same time, such broad               structural similarity may or may not be connected to any functional              similarity.  A database of protein structure and function will be built,         allowing a search for groups of proteins with certain structural and             functional features.  Such groups will then be analyzed to identify              structurally and functionally important regions in the sequence and to           match them with levels of structural and functional similarity/                  divergence.  A combination of comparative modeling and structure                 analysis of protein structures will be used and forged into a                    standardized set of theoretical tools and procedures that could be               predicted using threading and sequence analysis, but whose sequence              divergence is large enough to expect significant functional differences.         The overall goal of the research described in this project is to bring           an understanding of the sequence/structure/function relationship or              selected proteins to a level where the detailed predictions of function          and mode of action for newly sequenced proteins could be accomplished.           With the flood of new sequences coming from large scale genome                   sequencing projects, it is identifying the possible function of these            proteins that would make these data so important.                                 n/a",FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES,6150323,R01GM060049,"['DNA binding protein', ' RNA binding protein', ' active sites', ' artificial intelligence', ' binding proteins', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' molecular biology information system', ' open reading frames', ' periplasm', ' physical model', ' protein folding', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' structural biology', ' thermodynamics']",NIGMS,BURNHAM INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R01,2000,191240,-0.027625614669115995
"GENE PREDICTION--MARKOV MODELS AND COMPLEMENTARY METHODS   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): The goal of the project                                               is to build more accurate and powerful DNA sequence interpretation algorithms        utilizing the positive experience and ideas of previously proven GeneMark and        GenMark.hmm methods.                                                                                                                                                      We plan to improve the quality of gene finding in prokaryotic genomes in terms       of reliable and accurate prediction of gene starts and detection of frameshift                                                   sequencing errors. We also plan to develop a machine-learning iterative              procedure for deriving all necessary models for precise gene                         prediction/annotation from totally anonymous prokaryotic sequences.

"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis. Using          budding yeast genetics and digital imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we will           identify molecular components, including MT motor proteins, that are involved        with the coupling of force generation to the assembly/disassembly of MTs. We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs. Finally, we will analyze how MT dynamics may be involved in the               regulation of cytokinesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION,6132611,R01GM024364,"['Urodela', ' Xenopus', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell cycle', ' cell motility', ' centromere', ' chromosome movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system hardware', ' contact inhibition', ' cytoskeletal proteins', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' meiosis', ' microtubules', ' mitotic spindle apparatus', ' nanotechnology', ' photoactivation', ' protein binding', ' protein biosynthesis', ' protein structure function', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture', ' video microscopy', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2000,417043,0.008513849249303138
"COMPUTER BASED SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND RNA VIRUS EVOLUTION The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence         data to address the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the origin(s)          of all viruses and related genetic elements. Phylogenetic trees will             provide a framework for the mapping of cell and tissue tropism,                  pathogenicity and virulence, modes of transmission and geographical              distributions, and many other higher order characteristics of viruses.           The specific aims of proposed analytical studies are: 1) determining             functionally equivalent networks and frequency of exchange among and             between retroid elements, and their potential cellular homologues,               including new studies on 300 retroviral env proteins; 2) inferring               functionally important regions of all proteins of paramyxo-, rhabdo- and         filoviruses, (with privileged access to new Ebola sequences), and Borna          Disease virus, (including potential BDV sequences from schizophrenic             patients); and 3) the analysis of the dUTPase gene, as a model system,           to address issues relevant to the structure, function and evolution of           duplicated sequences, and potential horizontal transfer among and between        host and viral genomes. The specific aims of the technical studies are:          1) evaluation of stochastic production model approaches for generation           of multiple alignments, detection of recombination, and calculation of           evolutionary distances; and 2) development and testing of new and                existing methods for historical reconstruction of functionally equivalent        networks.                                                                                                                                                         RNA viruses (e.g. HIV, or Ebola) are the major causative agents of human,        animal and plant viral diseases world wide. The heterogeneous nature of          RNA populations makes it difficult to develop effective, anti-viral              agents. The sequence database is now large enough to conduct comparative         studies on natural variants versus chemotheraputically induced mutants           for several retroviral proteins. This model study will provide new               information on the nature of selected mutations which will be useful in          future anti-viral drug development.                                                                                                                               Computational analysis of primary sequence data is an area of intense            interest in biology, mathematics, statistics and systems science. In the         last few years new approaches to problem solving and classification, such        as machine learning, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and stochastic         production models or, ""intelligent systems"" as they are referred to              collectively, have become available. Unfortunately most biologists are           unaware of these developments. Application of these methods to real data         remains unexplored. The proposed studies will go a long way in rectifying        this gap in technological utilization. These studies will continue to            define important evolutionary relationships and events, provide                  biologically informative sequence relationships for bench-marking new            software, and contribute new information relevant to the structure and           function of viral proteins suggesting new directions in laboratory               experimentation.

"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,10020995,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2020,287504,0.0018446571588442754
"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9904662,R01GM101689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,310202,-0.0007914939438014436
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,-0.002101270822510615
"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,-0.019771356282581448
"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins. Reactome is the most comprehensive open source biological pathway knowledgebase.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry The identification and quantification of biological macromolecules remains challenging despite major advances in the speed, resolution and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers. A key weakness with current instrumentation lies in the methods used to induce fragmentation. The reliance in particular on collision-induced dissociation (CID) has limited such analyses to bottom-up workflows of trypsin-digested peptides of 10-30 residues. At e-MSion, we have developed an efficient electron-fragmentation technology called ExD for large proteins and are now co-marketed our ExD Option with Agilent, and soon will be with Thermo and Waters instruments. What has really captured the interest of the biopharma and top-down communities in the past year is the exceptional sequence coverage of native proteins we obtain with the same ExD cell. The resulting spectra are less congested than those obtained with currently available ETD/UVPD/CID fragmentation methodologies. We have shown that our technology works faster and gives cleaner spectra with more complete dissociation with larger macromolecular protein complexes than has ever been possible before, while still preserving labile post translational modifications. In addition, fragmentation with higher energy electrons can be used to provide complementary data to improve protein and glycan identification. The challenge now has become how to optimally collect and process these data to maximize the utility of ExD fragmentation. Last summer, Xilinx released its Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a massively parallel processor with 50 billion transistors targeted to transform digital signal processing, handling of big data and artificial intelligence. This ACAP technology has already accelerated Illumina DNA sequence assembly by 90-fold. Our feasibility question asks how to effectively harness this new highly parallelized technology to preprocess complex top-down mass spectra on- the-fly. This will allow us to actively optimize data acquisition by enabling adaptive operation of the ExD cell and mass spectrometer. The objective is to maximize both fragmentation and dissociation of native proteins, enabling faster and comprehensive characterization of challenging proteoforms important to the biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical researchers.  Success will offer an extremely fast, cost-effective solution to characterize complexes of macromolecules under native conditions with increased accuracy, speed, and fewer misidentifications. Our ExD technology with the Versal ACAP can be both retrofitted into existing mass spectrometers as well as being available in new generations of mass spectrometers at a price below other less-effective alternative fragmentation technologies like ETD and UVPD. Thus, it will provide new abilities for many NIH investigators to advance basic research, probe disease mechanisms and permit more sophisticated searches for both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Even with all of the scientific progress made to date, the complexity of disease-affected tissues still challenges our ability to probe what makes people sick. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a powerful computer technology to aid in characterizing biological molecules that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases ranging from arthritis, cancer, diabetes to heart disease and neurodegeneration.",Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry,10081127,R43GM139467,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Arthritis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuous Infusion', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Ions', 'Isoleucine', 'Laboratories', 'Leucine', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Polysaccharides', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Price', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transistors', 'Trypsin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disulfide bond', 'electron energy', 'encryption', 'experience', 'fragment X', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'operation', 'preservation', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'signal processing', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker']",NIGMS,"E-MSION, INC.",R43,2020,212830,-0.026611642963408854
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,10001530,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360797,0.0024036071666987645
"Combinatorial matrix-mimetic recombinant proteins as engineered nerve guidance conduits ABSTRACT Over 500,000 Americans suffer from peripheral nerve injury (PNI), and despite surgical interventions, most suffer permanent loss of motor function and sensation. Current clinical options for long nerve gap PNI include naturally- derived grafts, which provide native matrix cues to regenerate neurons but suffer from very limited supply and batch-to-batch variability, or synthetic nerve guidance conduits (NGCs), which are easy to manufacture but often fail due to lack of regenerative cues. The main challenge with using any NGC for treatment of PNI is the immense trade-off between providing the complex matrix cues necessary for optimal nerve regeneration while providing a conduit that is readily available, reproducible, and easily fabricated. To overcome this challenge, we propose an entirely new type of biomaterial: a computationally optimized, protein-engineered recombinant NGC (rNGC). This rNGC combines the reliability of synthetic NGCs with the presentation of multiple regenerative matrix cues of natural NGCs. Because current understanding of cell-matrix interactions is insufficient to enable to direct design of a fully functional rNGC, we hypothesize that the use of machine learning, computational optimization methods will allow identification of an rNGC that promotes nerve regeneration similar to the current gold standard autograft. We utilize a family of protein-engineered, elastin-like proteins (ELPs) that are reproducible, with predictable, consistent material properties, and fully chemically defined for streamlined FDA approval. Due to ELPs’ modular design, they have biomechanical (i.e. matrix stiffness) and biochemical (i.e. cell-adhesive ligand) properties that are independently tunable over a broad range. While numerous studies detail the effects of individual biomechanical or biochemical matrix cues on neurite outgrowth using single-variable approaches, their combinatorial effects have been largely unexplored as insufficient knowledge exists to make accurate predictions of their interactions a priori. This fundamentally prohibits the direct design of combinatorial matrix cues. We hypothesize that optimized presentation of biomechanical and biochemical cues will create a microenvironment that better mimics the native ECM milieu, resulting in synergistic ligand cross-talk to improve nerve regeneration. In Aim 1, we use computational optimization methods to identify the combination of ligand identities, ligand concentrations, and matrix stiffness that best enhances neurite outgrowth. We will develop and characterize a library of ELP variants with distinct cell-adhesive ligands derived from native ECM, and assess their ability to support neurite outgrowth from rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In Aim 2, we will validate our in vitro optimization results in a preclinical, rat sciatic nerve injury model. A core-shell, ELP-based rNGC with an inner core matrix of the optimized ELP formulation from Aim 1 will be fabricated and evaluated for its ability to enhance therapeutic outcome. Controls include reversed nerve autograft, hollow silicone conduit, and non-optimized ELP- based rNGC. This study would represent the first use of computational optimization methods to design a reproducible, reliable, recombinant biomaterial with multiple regenerative matrix cues. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main challenge with using nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) to bridge long peripheral nerve gap injuries is the immense trade-off between providing the complex matrix cues necessary for optimal nerve regeneration while providing a conduit that is readily available, reproducible, and easily fabricated. To address this challenge, here we utilize (1) computational optimization methods to identify the optimal biochemical and biomechanical matrix cues for nerve regeneration, and (2) advanced protein-engineering strategies to incorporate these cues into a recombinant NGC (rNGC).

"Rapid and Precise Molecular Pathway Modelling of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Infection Cycle with Human Host Protein and Therapeutic Interactions Project Summary The Reactome Knowledgebase is a widely used and internationally recognized expert-curated, open-source resource of a broad array of human biological processes and their disease counterparts, coupled to powerful tools for data analysis and display, and integrated with diverse community genomics resources. The work proposed here will add molecular annotations of the COVID-19 infection process mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, interactions between viral components and human host proteins that mediate the severity of viral infection, and the effects of therapeutics and drug-like compounds on both viral and host proteins. The resulting SARS-CoV-2 pathway annotations will provide a framework for pathway- and network-based data analysis and visualization, which will be critical for the interpretation of numerous COVID-19 studies now and in the future. In collaboration with a team of community experts in virology, drug design, and infectious disease, we will assemble information in two stages. First, a draft annotation will associate relevant SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV- 2 viral and host cell proteins with each stage of the infection process and the host response to it. These annotations will be immediately useful for identifying additional relevant interacting proteins, for assessing possible effects of variation in the host or viral proteins on specific steps of viral infection, and for identifying possible drug targets. In the second stage, the SARS-CoV-2 map will be annotated more extensively to fill in molecular details of each step in these processes and to highlight differences in the processes mediated by SARS- CoV-2 virus and related coronaviruses. This annotation process will continue for the duration of the project to incorporate newly validated molecular details as they are uncovered by the research community. All the data, code and tools developed by this project will be open source and open. Project Narrative Using long-established Reactome Knowledgebase standards for authorship, curation and peer-review of molecular pathway data from published and unpublished sources, we will annotate the molecular details of the processes by which SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 coronaviruses infect human cells. This will include the interactions among viral and host proteins, the expression of viral proteins likely to trigger innate and adaptive immunity, and an annotation of the molecular effects of drugs on these processes. Our strategy will allow rapid revision and extension of annotations as data accumulate, will support close integration with other community resources, and will generate a valuable resource for community analysis of experimental data sets relevant to COVID-19 disease.",Rapid and Precise Molecular Pathway Modelling of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Infection Cycle with Human Host Protein and Therapeutic Interactions,10165320,U41HG003751,"['2019-nCoV', 'Authorship', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Paper', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Severities', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'data tools', 'data visualization', 'experimental analysis', 'knowledge base', 'open source', 'protein expression', 'small molecule', 'structured data', 'tool', 'virology']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2020,310292,0.014875325446853415
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease.

"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9868886,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'de-immunization', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2020,188164,-0.008765342342052894
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9849781,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,393339,0.03740656280097221
"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation. Our results are expected to help shape ongoing efforts aimed at targeting the farnesyl transferase for therapeutic benefit in a variety of diseases.",Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences,10019396,R01GM132606,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CENP-E protein', 'Charge', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Monitor', 'Nuclear Lamin', 'Online Systems', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Pheromone', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Farnesylation', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ursidae Family', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biophysical analysis', 'farnesylation', 'genetic selection', 'in vivo', 'isoprenylation', 'next generation sequencing', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'protein farnesyltransferase', 'protein function', 'protein geranylgeranyltransferase', 'protein protein interaction', 'ras-Related G-Proteins']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,390494,0.007766676789899713
"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9986784,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,369690,0.0014690469673556835
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9875487,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,297077,-0.013782646089970737
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,10145865,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug resistance', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive test', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,9815,-0.006801488113258398
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9939578,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,321599,0.004859677272251979
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,9965720,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2020,741796,0.024781859329377865
"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation.

Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9983105,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,327738,0.015674023638957556
